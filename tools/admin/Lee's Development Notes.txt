lee's development notes

For user authentication there is a decent implementation of RBAC at: activerbac.turingstudio.com/releases
We will need to build a schema that can hold user data, and each of their individual tiddlers. 
Once that database exists we can create a web service back end (using XML_RPC) calls to login/read/write/create/delete to each tiddler based upon the tiddler ID
and the user session.                                                                  


Questions:
What does each tiddler look like to the database ? 
How much meta-data do we want to store for each tiddler ?                 
Do we want to store baseline versions of each of the tiddlers ?

current tasks:
need a page where a user can select their recipes as listed in the SVN repo
need a screen where an admin can associate a given user with a web space
when we associate a user with a given web space we create a new directory in a specific area (on disk) 
and link those two together, the root for this dir needs to be configured 
we will need to create directories for both the beta and production areas

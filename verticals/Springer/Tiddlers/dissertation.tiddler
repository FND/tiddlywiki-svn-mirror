Kupperman, major advisor)\n&lt;&lt;&lt;\n''Abstract:''  Moral agents spend as much of their attention responding critically to others’ choices as deliberating about their own. How is this activity related to moral agency? Most consequentialist and deontological theories lend themselves to legalistic, verdict-oriented scrutiny of actions around us, but they speak little to how such judgments should influence a critic's own choices. I argue that intervention in one another’s habits is central to moral life, but that our attitudes toward particular events are and must be more subtle than ‘approval’ and ‘disapproval’. An undercurrent of “thick” evaluative attitudes and reactions, developed without conscious moral premises, shapes our moral personality. Cognitive assessments of what should provoke us morally cannot simply override these. \n!\nCrucially, we can and do reshape each other’s evaluative reactions, however; and our ability to do so is a hallmark of moral interaction. I provide a naturalistic account of how moral complexity develops out of simpler practical competences. It suggests that the workings of praise, blame, and sanctions, for example, are fragile and context-sensitive, and must be fine-tuned and re-evaluated as social and cultural contexts evolve. Entrenched moral conflict, I argue, is generally not to be traced to inconsistent moral premises, but rather to histories of blunt or misdirected responses and interventions, and the moral resistance engendered all around by such dynamics. Critical inquiry into how we engage with others’ apparent moral blunders functions as a powerful engine of moral improvement, even in the absence of any other systematic moral theory.\n&lt;&lt;&lt;</div>

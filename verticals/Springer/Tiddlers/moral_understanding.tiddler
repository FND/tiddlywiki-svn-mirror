<div tiddler="moral understanding" modifier="ESpringer" modified="200508252337" created="200508252337" tags="">Are there multiple distinct varieties of understanding, or are patterns of understanding continuously interconnected? [[Daniel Dennett|http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/~ddennett.htm]], for example, writes of ''three stances'' for understanding: the physical stance, the design stance, and the intentional stance -- three &quot;lenses&quot; with which we can approach the same phenomenon (in different strategic circumstances, and with greater or lesser success). Are these (a) neatly distinct, (b) points on a continuum, or (c) variations on a theme?\n!\nWhat is the relation between [[moral understanding]] and &quot;other&quot; forms of understanding? Can I fully understand you as an agent (as an &quot;intender&quot;) without understanding you as a //moral// agent? Can one fully understand a speaker or writer as a linguistic agent without engaging in moral understanding? Or, from another angle, is the [[principle of charity]] necessary only for making rational sense of the world, or is it also necessary for making sense of our social and moral world? </div>

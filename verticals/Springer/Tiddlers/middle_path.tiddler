<div tiddler="middle path" modifier="ESpringer" modified="200508011819" created="200508011819" tags="">On [[Aristotle's account]], each virtue involves learning the appropriate mean between undesirable extremes (vices). The brave person, for example, keeps safely away from the temptations of cowardice, without straying into rashness. Such a model works better for some virtues than for others, but it does seem to fit well with the nature of critical virtue:\n!\nOn an ordinary practical level, the activity of moral criticism frequently leads to resistance, polarization and antagonism. Among those opposed to the vice of [[Judgmentalism]], one common response is to insist upon &quot;[[Judging Not]]&quot;, yet this is also plausibly treated as a vice at the other extreme.  Thus [[critical virtue]] requires honing a critical attitude (towards self as well as towards others) that remains constructive.</div>

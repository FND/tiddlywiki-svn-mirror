<div tiddler="two practical questions" modifier="ESpringer" modified="200508041914" created="200508041914" tags="">• ''On moral priorities'': Each of us is surrounded by demands on our moral attention. There are struggles for basic needs and for respect, both nearby and distant; there is neglect of living potential and constant degradation of the biosphere. On top of these concerns, there are the myriad ways to set out improving one's own character and resources. ''How do we clear a [[middle path]] between passivity and exhaustion?''\n!• ''On engaging in moral discussion'': It is easier to know that something's wrong than to understand how to react well. If we venture to criticize others' actions, ''how do we maintain a [[dialogue]] that remains open to learning?''\n\nThese questions aren't simply academic, but they are difficult and persistent enough to motivate philosophical reflection.  </div>

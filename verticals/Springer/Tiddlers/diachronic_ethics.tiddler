<div tiddler="diachronic ethics" modifier="ESpringer" modified="200508252328" created="200508252328" tags="">Many moral theorists have been starting to recognize that crucial moral concepts require attending to ''how things develop'' over time. \n![[Aristotelians|Aristotle's account]] have consistently recognized this, as individuals like ~MacIntyre suggest that a whole life has meaning in virtue of its narrative, which in turn has meaning against the narratives of a social-historical backdrop. In //Creating the Kingdom of Ends//, Korsgaard observes that Kantian evaluation of maxims only //seems// to ignore consequences because we're not noticing that a maxim involves attention over time. The result is closer to Aristotle than we might have expected from a Kantian: the success of many of our moral projects is still ''undecided'', and is resolved only after our active lives have ended. \n!The most extreme embrace of diachronic ethics would shift moral evaluation almost entirely to the ''process'' by which we evolve and influence one another over time, and place very little weight on the evaluation of a character, an action, or an outcome at just one instant of time. In other words, it would stand in strong tension with the [[verdict model]] as it is usually pursued.</div>

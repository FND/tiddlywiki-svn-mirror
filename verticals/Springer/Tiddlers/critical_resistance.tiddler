<div tiddler="critical resistance" modifier="Elise Springer" modified="200602031248" created="200602031248" tags="concepts">The major obstacle to a [[verdict model]] of moral criticism is its refusal to reflect upon ''critical resistance'' -- meaning the morally significant resistance to most forms of critical pressure. Only a narrow range of human relationships are conducive to moral criticism. An [[ecological model|ecological theory]] of responsibility and criticism suggests that criticism is truly something to which relationships are more or less ''conducive'', creating a dynamic social field of pathways and resistances.</div>

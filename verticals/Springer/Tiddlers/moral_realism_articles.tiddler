I'm not convinced. However, Bransen's positive suggestion is still welcome: ~McDowell would benefit from greater attention to cases in which moral perceptions and inclinations diverge. Working through such situations is crucial to the development of moral insight. \n!''Thomas E. Hill, Jr. &quot;Kantian Constructivism in Ethics&quot;'' (//Ethics// 1999)\n!''Marc Lange, &quot;Salience, Supervenience, and Layer Cakes'' in Sellars's Scientific Realism, Mc Dowell's Moral Realism, and the Philosophy of Mind&quot; (//Philosophical Studies//, 2000)\n!!Shows the analogies among supervience models for scientific laws, ethical properties, and folk psychological kinds, and defends the plausibility of ~McDowell's model with careful attention to Blackurn-style objections (as analogous to Van Fraassen's &quot;constructive&quot; empiricism)</div>

[[Margaret Urban Walker|http://www.asu.edu/clas/justice/faculty/profiles/margaret_walker/margaret_walker.htm]] draws attention to what she calls &quot;practices of responsibility&quot;, and this is an improvement over talk of responsibility as a static property. If responsibility is not simply &quot;discovered&quot;, assessed, and disclosed via language, but shaped and ''cultivated'', then we need to attend more to the ''conditions'' under which our talk of responsibility fosters and supports its development.\n!My emerging view might be called an [[ecological|ecological theory]] or ''dynamic'' view of responsibility, on which an individual's responsibility cannot be understood in isolation from the responsibility of those who either perceive and make claims upon it or who are in turn called upon by it.\n!Among [[social affordances]], responsibility has a complex structure: for it implies both that the agent in question is to be apporached as liable, answerable, and accountable for existing problems (a dimension of dissatisfaction and subordination of the agent to various concerns), and that the agent is potentially to-be-trusted and can be expected to recognize and act on behalf of shared goods (a dimension of satisfaction and recognition of agency).\n!From this angle, the &quot;[[precarious]]ness&quot; of our concepts of responsibility suggests ''not a metaphysical problem'' about causality or freedom, but a practical attention to the complexity of moral attitudes. What makes attributions of responsibility appropriate is not any property internal to the agent in question, though it is a ''real'' feature of dynamic relations among agents. \n!See also [[responsibility articles]] and [[moral realism articles]]</div>

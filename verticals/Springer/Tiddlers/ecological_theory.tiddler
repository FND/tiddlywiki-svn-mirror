<div tiddler="ecological theory" modifier="ESpringer" modified="200508301530" created="200508301530" tags="">This focus on ecology and systems-based approaches was pioneeed by [[Gregory Bateson|http://www.indiana.edu/~wanthro/bateson.htm]]:\n&lt;&lt;tiddler BatesonOnContexts&gt;&gt;J.J. Gibson, apparently inspired in part by [[William James]], pursued an ''ecological'' paradigm in psychology of perception, considering an organism and its environment as dynamically interdependent. Gibson's account of perception suggests that the fundamental stuff of perception is not meaningless sensations that must be &quot;decoded&quot;, but structures of information that specify what possibilities for action (what &quot;affordances&quot;) ''connect'' the organism and environment.\n\nIn moral theory, an ecological account would require shifting our main focus away from moral properties (rightness, wrongness, virtue, vice) and toward the kinds of interactions by which relationships convey and cultivate [[responsibilities|responsibility]], which are essentially social projects. One wishing to make moral claims is ''not'' observing moral properties from a neutral position, but is always exercising relational moral agency in a way that must be located within the system about which claims are made.</div>

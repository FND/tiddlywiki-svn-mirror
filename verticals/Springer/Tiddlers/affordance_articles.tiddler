<div tiddler="affordance articles" modifier="ESpringer" modified="200508091732" created="200508091732" tags="articles">The discussion within ''ecological psychology'' of //affordances// interests me for two reasons: \n# Gibson's claims about the contents of perception are close analogues to pragmatist claims about the contents of cognition. Given a [[pragmatist account]] of [[responsibility]], I suspect that it may in some cases be perceived &quot;directly&quot; in Gibson's sense (that is, not only inferred from &quot;neutral&quot; data).\n# The Gibsonians who do social psychology might be grappling more openly with the tension between action that's immediately possible for an agent and action that the agent could recognize to be possible in an &quot;at large&quot; sense. Should different people have different perceptions of responsibility (because they have different ''situated abilities'' to engage and call forth others' responsiveness), or should the medium of language force [[representation]]s to converge?\n!''Andrea Scarantino, &quot;Affordances Explained&quot;'' (//Philosophy of Science//, 2003)\n!!This piece offers a concise explanation of affordances, with a focus on making affordances palatable even for those who reject some of Gibson's anti-inferentialism. Scarantino makes several distinctions sound firmer than they are in practice, but nothing would be lost by casting them as matters of degree. \n!''Aaron Ben Zeev, &quot;The Kantian Revolution in Perception&quot;'' (//Journal for the Theory of Social Behavior//, 1984)\n!!This piece outlines the Kantian flavor of the Gibsonian move of allowing significance to be ''already present'' in perception rather than imposed between sensation and judgment, and goes on to question whether Gibson requires the equivalent of Kantian &quot;schemata&quot;.\n!''G.P. Ginsburg, &quot;The Ecological Perception Debate&quot;'' (//Journal for the Theory of Social Behavior//, 1990)\n!!A nice overview of what's at stake in the intersection between ecological psychology and philosophical accounts of perception.\n!''Harry Heft, &quot;Affordances, Dynamic Experience, and the Challenge of Reification&quot;'' (//Ecological Psychology//, 2002)\n!!Highlights for me the optimistic view towards a synthesis of pragmatist moral theory and ecological psychology, by way of [[canonical affordances|quotes.html#%5B%5Bcanonical%20affordances*%5D%5D]]\n!''Darren Newtson, &quot;Alternatives to Representation or Alternative Representations: Comments on te Ecological Approach&quot;'' (//Contemporary Social Psychology// 1990)\n!!Newtson pushes Lewin's radical approach to social phenomena as dynamical systems, [[rejecting representation|quotes.html#%5B%5Brejecting%20representation*%5D%5D]] (in the sense of topological &quot;mappings&quot; of the environment).\n!''William G. Noble, &quot;Gibsonian Theory and the Pragmatist Perspective&quot;'' (//J Theory Social Behaviour//, 1981)\n!!Attends to difficulties with [[Gibson, language, and norms*|quotes.html#%5B%5BGibson%2C%20language%2C%20and%20norms*%5D%5D]], calling for more of Mead's insights, which seems right to me. \n</div>

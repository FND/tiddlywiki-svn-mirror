<div tiddler="teaching technology" modifier="ESpringer" modified="200602201759" created="200601091626" tags="teaching">No sharp line divides &quot;technology&quot; from &quot;technique,&quot; and teaching has always involved methods and tools -- &quot;technology&quot; -- of some kind. Although liberal arts and non-quantitative social sciences have tended to be rightly skeptical of a rush towards classroom electronics, a generation of software has ''nearly matured'' in facilitating text-oriented studies. This site is an experiment with TiddlyWiki, one promising tool. I have also begun another similar site, [[Reasoning Well|http://parmenides.objectis.net/reason]], strictly focused on concepts needed for skill in informal reasoning.\n!\nIn Spring 2005, I began seeking a better virtual environment for ''ongoing exchange'' among seminar participants, and settled on ''[[courseforum|http://www.courseforum.com]]'', a free-form alternative to [[Blackboard|http://blackboard.wesleyan.edu/]]. While it is not yet perfect, multiple students remarked to the effect that it offered //&quot;among the most successful uses of online spaces in a class that I've taken.&quot;// If you're interested in a guest tour of our online space, please [[email me|mailto:espringer@wesleyan.edu]]. There are also more structured tools that include collaborative wiki rooms, such as the open source [[moodle|http://moodle.org/]] project. \n!\nStarting in Fall 2005, I've been using [[ZiddlyWiki|http://www.ziddlywiki.org]] for interactive course websites. ~ZiddlyWiki provides an interface just like this home page, but multiple users can log in over the net and contribute items that link to one another. My Fall 2005 [[Introduction to Ethics]] course has been [[archived here|212fa05.html]]. My current [[PHIL 218|218 Identity &amp; Choice]] site cannot be altered without a password, but portions of it can be viewed [[here|http://parmenides.objectis.net/218/]].\n!\nI also use a ''database'' engine to support ''classroom discussion'' through spontaneous projection and markup of relevant philosophical text -- not just excerpts from famous philosophers, but also snippets of recent ''student writing'' (via FileMakerPro). \n!\nFaculty interested in classroom projection using a Mac might also enjoying using [[PinPoint|http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/1500]], a simple bit of shareware that offers a large translucent ''cursor.'' It's ''easy to locate and follow'', but doesn't obstruct any of the content behind it.</div>

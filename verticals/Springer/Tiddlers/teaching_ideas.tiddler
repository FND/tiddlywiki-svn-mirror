<div tiddler="teaching ideas" modifier="ESpringer" modified="200511181729" created="200511181729" tags="teaching">Philosophy [[courses]] can provide both students and professors with something that no amount of independent reading can provide -- a chance to find common ground, listen to unexpected interpretations, and revise our thoughts on the basis of dialogue. Inside and outside of class sessions, I take each student's questions and concerns as a starting-point for discussion. Because [[dialogue]] is the basis of all philosophy, I expect students to write and revise frequently. In exchange for this effort, I offer extensive written commentary. \n!I am also interested in the development of [[teaching technology]] tools that help to build skills (see [[reasoning well|http://parmenides.objectis.net/reason/]]) and to create dialogical space.</div>

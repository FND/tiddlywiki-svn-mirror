For that matter, dialogue is crucial even if there are ideals, as long as individual cannot be sure of //how// to tune in to them.\n!Dialogue is notoriously difficult, and most attempts to compose philosophical dialogues are thinly-veiled attempts to push one voice or the other. Surely [[critical virtue]] requires taking [[responsibility]] not just for the content of what we say, but for how we embed it in [[dialogue]], with or without [[irony]].</div>

<div tiddler="bicycling &amp; moral priorities" modifier="ESpringer" modified="200601041621" created="200601041621" tags="">!Is the choice to bicycle a ''moral choice'', or merely a ''personal preference''? Is it a personal preference justified -- retrospectively and righteously -- as a moral matter? If I do believe cycling has moral significance, is it still better to show people why they might prefer cycling, rather than insisting upon its moral credentials?\n!Even while morality requires seeing &quot;the big picture&quot;, we end up becoming ''moral specialists'', each with talents and histories and networks of friends on similar wavelengths. Those who are struck directly by an oppression, and yet who manage to resist it, cannot help but shoulder it as a moral priority. Those who recognize just how cruel and unreasonable we become in pursuit of our appetites (our consumerism, our thirst for power, our taste for meat) often become better attuned to how such vices work and how we can resist them.\n!It is easy, from the vantage-point of a bicycle-seat, to discern the ''moral benefits'' of cycling over driving: there is the bit of gas saved, the moment of congestion avoided, the bit of interaction fostered by enjoying the same quiet sky as elderly people on porches, gardeners and dogs in the field, and children playing in driveways. It is easy, while gulping air at an intersection behind a mammoth luxury SUV, to notice the difference in quality between clean air and exhaust. \n!Yet the differences made by leaving the car at home are ''all minimal'', and thus the commitment to commuting by bicycle is as much symbolic as directly beneficial. Perhaps I would do better by driving to work and devoting the fifteen minutes' difference to lobbying politicians, reading and writing more about world events, or volunteering time towards local organizations. These things are worthwhile, but I do not see myself coolly trading these off against cycling time.\n!I suspect our moral engagements must settle for this ''tension between symbolic and effective change''. Moral reflection and conversation should help us notice the moral dimensions of all of our choices, but a certain moral alienation sets in when we seek to survey all the world's problems at once. In order to stave off that moral alienation, it helps to develop our little niches of insight and satisfaction. One might say that cycling is a ''moral passion'': it is one cause that has &quot;swept me off my feet&quot;, and it is a good thing that we are able to be affected in such ways. \n!So it would be foolish to imagine that those not yet moved in the same way are morally insensitive. I come to cycling through the ''happenstance'' of a certain state of health and mobility, a certain career, a certain terrain, and the wherewithal to equip a bicycle for relative (and only relative) safety. In moments of enthusiasm I still say that [[everyone who can should|http://www.runmuki.com/commute/]] prefer the bicycle to the automobile. The real lesson, though, would be to recognize this fragile contingency that steers our moral priorities, and to get the hang of other ways to feel connected to the moral dimensions of what we do.\n[img[cycling|images/cycledoodle.gif]]</div>

<div tiddler="precarious" modifier="ESpringer" modified="200508042010" created="200508042010" tags="">&quot;The precarious&quot;, as it plays with and against &quot;the stable&quot;, is the dynamic term in [[John Dewey]]'s controversial -- //precariously received//-- metaphysics. Whether something is precarious is, of course, a matter ''relative'' to the timeframe and interests we bring to the matter. A practice's ability to function well may be precarious in ways that are not transparent to even those who are fluent with it. The skills of [[critical virtue]] are precariously dependent on personal, cultural, and historical variables. \n![[Martha Nussbaum]] embeds a similar point in her title phrase, //The Fragility of Goodness// -- though goodness is in some cases remarkably ''resilient'' as well.</div>

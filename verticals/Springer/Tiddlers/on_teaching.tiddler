<div tiddler="on teaching" modifier="ESpringer" modified="200508141617" created="200508141617" tags="epigraphs excludeLists">!!One of the most important of the teacher's or preacher's qualifications, yet one of the rarest, is a ''knowledge of the hearer's mind'', so that his discourse may ''answer to something'', or else raise clear and profitable questions. Most philosophical books, lectures, and sermons seem to me either mechanical performance, or else the offspring of subtile vanity and desire for intellectual sympathy. Let one persuade many, and he becomes confirmed and convinced, and cares for no better evidence. ... \n!!!!-- Chauncey Wright, as quoted by Philip Weiner\n!!For instance, ''if I am'' a professor, then this means that I am ''in the midst of'' trying to be a professor, and this is a norm-governed, ''ongoing project'' with respect to which my success always continues to be at issue. ... I must in some sense ''always be making this demand'' of myself... However, my //recognition// of this demand will necessarily bring an end to the immediacy of my immersion in my projects... will require me to ''put into question'' the legitimacy of my commitment to these projects... we ''never complete'' the task of choosing our commitments.\n!!!!-- Rebecca Kukla, &quot;The Ontology and Temporality of Conscience&quot;\n!!... work that is highly abstract, jargonistic, difficult to read,...theory that ''cannot be shared'' in everyday conversation... may function ''to legitimize'' Women's Studies and feminist scholarship... but ''it undermines'' and subverts feminist movements... many women have responded to hegemonic feminist theory that does not speak clearly to us by trashing theory... By internalizing the ''false'' assumption ''that theory is not a social practice''... both groups deny the power of liberatory education for critical consciousness...\n!!!!-- bell hooks, &quot;Theory as Liberatory Practice&quot;</div>

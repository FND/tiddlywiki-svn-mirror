After all, almost all of what we need to handle in our work has ''data structure'' to it. Still, many sound pedagogical uses of textual data have never been anticipated by a commercial programmer. \n!\nUsing a user-friendly, flexible, and powerful database engine ([[FileMakerPro|www.filemaker.com]]) has allowed me to track and navigate everything from bibliography and text excerpts to syllabus structure, from archived feedback for students to group-based project-tracking, and to interrelate anything without limitations. Though most of this work is never directly visible to students, such technology makes it possible to ''direct attention in new ways'' that otherwise would be too cumbursome.\n!I am always happy to field inquiries. \n[img[FileMakerTables|images/databases3.jpg]]</div>

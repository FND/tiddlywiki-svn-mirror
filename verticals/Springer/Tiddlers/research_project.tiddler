<div tiddler="research project" modifier="YourName" modified="200603161754" created="200602041911" tags="Research">My research, starting with the [[dissertation]] project, focuses on the relationship between moral ideals and the ''activity of criticism''. A //[[Critical Responsibilities]]// text is in process, with [[chapters]] in various stages of development and revision.\n!The impetus for this work begins with a question: In cases of [[moral provocation]] -- being troubled by someone's deeds or by conflict -- how does a responsible moral agent proceed? A [[verdict model]] of criticism requires that we ''reach judgment'' on each act under scrutiny: it must be assessed on its merits, by principle or by consequences. Supposing we could confidently reach such justified moral verdicts, is it clear what role these play in responsible moral ''criticism''? It seems the problems of deciding upon an appropriate reaction are as complex as the initial problem, and not much resolved by any intermediate step of judgment. Thus, I seek an [[alternative account]] that integrates [[representation]] and ''responsive agency''.\n!Additional research interests include [[irony]], [[dialogue]], [[responsibility]], Feminist Theories of Agency, Speech Act Theory, and [[Pragmatist Philosophy]].</div>

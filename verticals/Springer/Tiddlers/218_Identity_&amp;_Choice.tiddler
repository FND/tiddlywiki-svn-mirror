The seminar introduces the metaphysical questions associated with identity and with choice, drawing parallels and connections between issues in both domains. We start by exploring classic extreme positions: Plato and the Stoics on the soul and its faculty of choice, Buddha's view of no-self, Mettrie's determinism and Chisholm's argument for the freedom of agents. We then navigate between the extremes by examining the importance of narrative, social identity, complexity of the self, and changes over time.\n!\nWe will explore philosophical reflections on the problem of personal identity, and its relationship to matters of choice and freedom. How do certain experiences and thoughts and physical materials compose one self? Am I the same person over time even through complete transformations of experience, thought and material? Can I choose which elements of my existence to count as essential? Some argue the concept of a unified and enduring self partakes of illusion; at the other extreme some argue for the permanent integrity of individual souls. \n!\nRegarding choice and freedom, we find a related debate, ranging from those who deny free will altogether to those who define humanity's essence in terms of choice and agency. Might we coherently say that some human selves can have more integrity, and others less? What gives a measure of meaningful coherence to a person's life? Similarly, can we distinguish some choices as more free than others? What makes for meaningful choice? \n!\nBesides serving as an introduction to philosophical reasoning, the course will draw interdisciplinary connections on themes such as social identities, religious experience, political freedom, and legal responsibility.\n!\nVisitors may view portions of our online forum [[here|http://parmenides.objectis.net/218]].</div>

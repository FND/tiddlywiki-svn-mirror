FitzPatrick, &quot;The Practical Turn in Ethical Theory|•FitzPatrick on Korsgaard]]'': Korsgaard's Constructivism, Realism, and … Normativity&quot; (//Ethics// 2005)\n!''Claudia Card, &quot;Responsibility Ethics, Shared Understandings and Moral Communities&quot;'' (//Hypatia//, 2002)\n!!Card engages with Margaret Urban Walker's //Moral Understandings//, embracing the project and many of its details, though she raises some concerns about whether Walker's &quot;expressive-collaborative&quot; approach fully embraces our moral responsibilities in relation to those with whom we cannot &quot;share understandings&quot;, such as distant people, non-human animals, and ecosystems.  \n!''Nick Zangwill, &quot;Against Moral Response- Dependence&quot;'' (//Erkenntnis// 2003)\n!!Zangwill's complaint is that response-dependent theories are either non-normative or normative, and either way there's a fatal problem. We can't make our moral conviction //intelligible// to ourselves by claiming, say, that we believe something is &quot;such as to prompt my disapproval&quot; (as the non-normative version seems to do). Meanwhile, the normative strain (as in ~McDowell's) is vacuous, for it does not tell us what about the thing makes it warrant the normative response. Zangwill offers no positive account here. It seems to me that the dilemma he points out here can be pushed on //any// account of moral properties as such. Some deep ontological assumptions at the root of moral theory seem to be responsible for the persistent gap between &quot;givens&quot; and &quot;takens&quot;...\n!''Rafael De Clercq, &quot;Two Conceptions of Response- Dependence&quot;'' (//Philosophical Studies//, 2002)\n!!This piece offers an alternative understanding of &quot;response-dependence&quot; to cover properties that cannot be instantiated unless people at some point have a concept of it. The intuitive point, which is that some properties' very realization (in any specific case) depends upon there being (at some point) an ability to appreciate those properties, seems plausible. However, the paper is burdened with heaps of gratuitous symbolization and requires us to buy into a notion of &quot;//a priori// warrant&quot; for some claims. \n!''Wiggins, &quot;A Sensible Subjectivism?&quot;'' (//Needs, Values, Truth//, 1987)\n!!I'm still ''not sure why'' in the world Wiggins calls this position subjectivism, after acknowledging the differences between viable and non-viable response-patterns and the social-evolutionary interdependence of properties and responses. Many of Wiggins' premises seem compatible with ~McDowell's conclusions! Like many authors in this discussion, though, Wiggins speaks of &quot;responses&quot; as if they were the &quot;end of the line&quot; in our subjective experience, rather than gestures towards ongoing interaction that has functions and purposes. Despite these problems, the piece offers insightful philosophical twists.\n''Jan Bransen, &quot;On the Incompleteness of Mc Dowell’s Moral Realism&quot;'' (//Topoi//, 2002)\n!!Bransen argues that ~McDowell cannot ward off projectivism unless he gves an account of exactly what counts as &quot;appropriate&quot; moral subjects and &quot;favourable&quot; moral circumstances. I'm not convinced. However, Bransen's positive suggestion is still welcome: ~McDowell would benefit from greater attention to situations in which ''moral perceptions and inclinations diverge''. Working through such situations is crucial to the development of moral insight. \n!''Carla Bagnoli, &quot;Moral Constructivism: A Phenomenological Argument&quot;'' (//Topoi//, 2002)\n!!Many of the points here are plausible as against a ~McDowell-style realism: &quot;the image of construction suggests that &quot;the situation&quot; is not merely given, standing before the agent, waiting for her to make up her mind or to simply discover the right solution... the image of a contsrained construction highlights the diachronic dimension of our evaluations...&quot; \n!!Yet perhaps Bagnoli is moving towards a more genuinely world-changing kind of ''real construction'' than the entrenched Kantian sort of constructivism, and thus I'm not sure her position ought to count as anti-realist.\n!''Alasdair MacIntyre, //Dependent Rational Animals// (1999)''\n\n!... and some [[affordance articles]], [[responsibility articles]], [[moral realism articles]], [[on teaching]], [[on speech agency]].</div>

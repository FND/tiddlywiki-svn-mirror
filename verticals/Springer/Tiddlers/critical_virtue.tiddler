<div tiddler="critical virtue" modifier="ESpringer" modified="200508252333" created="200508252333" tags="">Aristotle describes virtues as states of character, developed through lifelong ''experience'', which enable us to make wise practical choices. Each virtue represents an understanding of how to function well ''in a key domain'' of human experience. Generally, on his account, a virtue requires attunement to the [[middle path]] between vices, where at least one extreme state is tempting, and another represents an overcompensation or inflexible attempt at moral excellence. \n!Still, Aristotle tends to write of the praiseworthiness and blameworthiness of ordinary character traits without direct attention to the ''activities of praise and blame'' or to the character of one who approaches these well. If our moral characters are largely shaped by social intervention and evaluative cues, then these activities are themselves something ''we learn to do more or less well''. This sort of virtue, along with its implications for moral theory, is the subject of my [[research project]].</div>

<div tiddler="a philosophical broom" modifier="ESpringer" modified="200508261417" created="200508261417" tags="excludeLists">Something is a '''blog'' -- a weblog -- only if it is a ''log'' of some kind, a sedimentary accumulation of entries about ongoing events. A log does not invite revision, and indeed part of its function is to serve as a ''fixed record'' for future reference.\n!The writing here however, undergoes constant ''revision'', and there is no entry which serves as a fixed record. So if we are to take [[metaphors]] seriously, I'd call it a sort of room -- perhaps a back porch room for welcoming guests and offering some philosophical //hors d'oeuvres//. The furniture, the books, and the conversations will appear and disappear. As the space evolves, some corners may be tidied up, but there is always likely to be a corner of unsorted mischief.\n!So, what I have to offer is not exactly a blog, but more of a ''web room''. And if a web log is a 'blog, then a web room must be a '''broom''.</div>

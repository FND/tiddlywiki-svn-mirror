<div tiddler="verdict model" modifier="ESpringer" modified="200508030101" created="200508030101" tags="">It is not common for a verdict-oriented model to be clearly articulated by proponents; it tends to pass as common sense that what a moral critic is doing is expressing moral judgments which aim to be true assessments of the ''moral status'' or properties of an action (or an agent). Such judgment is to be derived from basic moral principles, whether deontological, consequentialist, or virtue-theory-based. \n!Though some verdict theorists advocate &quot;particularist&quot; attention to details about the act in question, they do not allow that the circumstances of a //critic's// utterance is relevant to moral judgment. The [[critical virtue]] approach is thus a more radical challenge to standard accounts of judgment.</div>

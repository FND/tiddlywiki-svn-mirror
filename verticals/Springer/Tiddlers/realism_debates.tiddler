<div tiddler="realism debates" modifier="ESpringer" modified="200508091733" created="200508091733" tags="research">Much recent meta-ethics focuses on whether moral properties are ''real'', or whether something in the world &quot;makes moral claims true&quot;. ''Realism'' has been contrasted against various forms of ''relativism'' which tie moral truths to subjective perspectives or cultural points of view.\n!\nBetween these &quot;objective&quot; and &quot;subjective&quot; poles, of course, mediating positions emerge. Views generally labelled ''constructivist'' suggest that actual perspectives and attitudes provide the grounds for moral status, but that moral truths are the product of rigorous reflective work upon these. \n!\nI would take a more literal approach to the notion of ''constructivism'' in ethics: the creation and maintenance of moral features of the world require ongoing work: moral truths are constructed not simply out of points of view, but out of interactions that quite literally bring [[responsibility]] into being. What is ''constructed'' is both fully real, and fully natural, though it is historically malleable, evolving, and [[precarious]].</div>

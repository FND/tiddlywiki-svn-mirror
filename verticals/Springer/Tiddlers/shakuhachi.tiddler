<div tiddler="shakuhachi" modifier="ESpringer" modified="200507031350" created="200507031350" tags="">The shakuhachi, a Japanese meditative flute, is a temperamental but rewarding piece of bamboo. Although there is a concert repetoire joining shakuhachi with other traditional instruments such as koto and shamisen, the shakuhachi has evolved mostly to foster meditation through breathing and listening. \n\n[img[shakuhachi|shaku.jpg]]</div>

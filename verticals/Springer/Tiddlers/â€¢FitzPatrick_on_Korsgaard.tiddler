<div tiddler="â€¢FitzPatrick on Korsgaard" modifier="ESpringer" modified="200508271912" created="200508271912" tags="review">''William J. ~FitzPatrick, &quot;The Practical Turn in Ethical Theory'': Korsgaard's Constructivism, Realism, and the Nature of Normativity&quot; (//Ethics// 2005)\n!~FitzPatrick argues that Korsgaard's arguments against realism and in favor of constructivism fail. He thinks that a realist can appropriate her basic strategy of hooking moral motivation to the experienced problems of agency (the need to act on reasons), while something's counting as the best ''solution'' to such a problem could easily have to do with normative truth as a primary fact instead of with normativity as constructed by agents as sources of value. \n!Fitzpatrick's &quot;matter-of-fact&quot; premises about ''what agents actually do'' accomplish all the time (such as locating sources of value in God, or refusing to be consistent) are vital to his argument, but they miss the genuine constructivist angle on agency. As much as striving for agency implies considering one's reasons in certain ways, the constructivist must say that those who do not approach themselves and their reasons in such ways cannot count as agents. But that way of putting it misleads. More properly: if //I// cannot take you to be acting on reasons and if //I// do not take you to be a source of value, then //I// cannot take you to be an agent. (I take you to be a pawn of the priests, or a wanton, etc.) Not only morality, but ''agency'' itself, as ''a normative concept'', must be contantly constructed on a Kantian account.\n!Yet I am also ''unsatisfied with Kantian constructivism''. It seems to me that Korsgaard has not provided a sufficient argument against realism. since the best realism does not involve mysteriously radiant truths, but rather insists that moral concepts are realized in the world around us, and that moral inquiry requires learning about things such as whether (and in what ways) human bodies are the locus of agency. The realist need not deny that reality has the features it does because of our constructive practices, but simply needs to insist that moral constructions never start from scratch, but rather with a moral landscape that instantiates some but not other moral properties. \n!Further, I think Korsgaard might be vacillating between interpretive constructions of reason and causal constructions of reality. After all, on her account, if someone acts on the right sorts of reasons, I take it that for Korsgaard this person ''has achieved'' agency. But to say such a thing is to be a realist, and not (only) a constructivist after all... And that sort of realism, on which ''being an agent'' is not merely a matter of ''being taken as'' an agent by others, is at least half right. Being an agent ''does not reduce'' to being taken as an agent, but it causally requires //having been taken as// an agent in a way that the realism/constructivism debate cannot recognize as long as they think those two terms stand in opposition to each other.</div>

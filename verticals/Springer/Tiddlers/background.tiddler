<div tiddler="background" modifier="ESpringer" modified="200512022318" created="200512022318" tags="">I came to study philosophy via a circuitous route through Music (A.A., Simon's Rock College, 1988; B.A., Wesleyan University 1990). An interest in the meaning-structures of music led me to pursue philosophy, and my interests in graduate school evolved by way of feminist philosophy toward a [[research project]] in moral theory and criticism. My [[dissertation]] was completed at the [[University of Connecticut|http://www.philosophy.uconn.edu/]], in 2000. I have previously taught in the University of Connecticut system and at Simon's Rock College, Syracuse University, and Hartwick College. I am now an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at [[Wesleyan University|www.wesleyan.edu]] in Middletown, CT. </div>

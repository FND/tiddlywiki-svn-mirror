Mead, &quot;The Philosophical Basis of Ethics&quot;\n!!''Relativists'' often see their view as conducive to ''respect''. But relativism isnâ€™t necessary or sufficient for respect, and the mere expression of [[moral criticism|critical virtue]] should not be conflated with violence or coercion.'' \n!!!!--Michele ~Moody-Adams, //Fieldwork in Familiar Places//</div>

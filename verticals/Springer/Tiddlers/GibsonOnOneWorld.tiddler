''There is only one world'', however diverse, and all animals live in it, although we human animals have ''altered'' it to suit ourselves. We have done so wastefully, ''thoughtlessly'', and, if we do not mend our ways, fatally.\n!!!!--J.J. Gibson, //The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception//, 1979</div>

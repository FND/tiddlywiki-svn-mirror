<div tiddler="G.H. Mead" modifier="ESpringer" modified="200508030052" created="200508030052" tags="people">[[George Herbert Mead|http://www.iep.utm.edu/m/mead.htm]], a social psychologist, philosopher, and close friend of [[John Dewey]]'s, approached the development of self as the product of social interaction, and sought to cast moral problem-solving as a dynamic process which doesn't simply put constraints on a pre-moral self, but rather gives the self substance and significance. His [[interactionist model]] has been more influential within sociology and psychology than within philosophy, though his ideas are both philosophically and morally insightful.  </div>

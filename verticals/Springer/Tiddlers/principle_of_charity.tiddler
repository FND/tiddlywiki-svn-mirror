<div tiddler="principle of charity" modifier="ESpringer" modified="200508190032" created="200508190032" tags="">Philosophers most often invoke the &quot;principle of charity&quot; in the context of interpreting linguistic utterances; it means making the best possible sense of someone's words rather than settling for an interpretation on which the speaker must be very ignorant or illogical.\n!In the context of ethics, a principle of charity concerns the interpretation of action. To interpret an action charitably is to seek out ways to understand either its aim or its origin so as best to preserve our ability to discern some kind of moral agency behind it. \n!The principle of charity in ethics is most deeply challenged by the claim that [[evil]] names a genuine intrinsic feature of some people's actions.</div>

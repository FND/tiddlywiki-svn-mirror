<div tiddler="social affordances" modifier="ESpringer" modified="200508091731" created="200508091731" tags="">J.J. Gibson elaborated the idea of an &quot;affordance&quot; -- a feature of the environment insofar as it directs or affords opportunities for action -- as the building block of all perception for organisms. Although affordances can differ between agents (as what is reachable for you may not be reachable for me), they are not merely subjective: each of us can still err in our perception of affordances, and we can ''correct misrepresentations'' and otherwise ''learn'' in the domain of affordances. In this sense, affordances are objective.\n!A Social Affordance is an affordance which is subject to [[representation]] through language and which implicitly appeals to &quot;what can be done&quot; by an unspecified agent (what Mead calls the &quot;Generalized Other&quot;), or by groups of agents. For a river to be &quot;bridgeable&quot; is for it to be subject to a certain kind of coordinated social treatment. The appropriateness of such a claim depends on many contextual variables, is not simply &quot;in the eye of the beholder&quot;.\n!(See also [[affordance articles]])</div>

<div tiddler="Quotations" modifier="ESpringer" modified="200601222240" created="200601222240" tags="excludeSearch excludeLists">!!Thus, within academic sociology, the internal connection that often holds between the emergence of social movements and the moral ''experience of disrespect'' has, to a large extent, been theoretically severed at the start. The motives for rebellion, protest, and [[resistance|critical resistance]] have generally been transformed into categories of 'interest'... without ever being linked... to the everyday web of ''moral feelings''.\n!!!!-Axel Honneth, //The Struggle for Recognition: The Moral Grammar of Social Conflicts// (1996)\n!!''Dissident speech'' must address more than one audience if it is to achieve its political aims.... For this reason, I have urged that it would be ''self-defeating'' for a socially excluded group ''to speak with a single voice'' in a single register... [[Counterfigurations|metaphors]] must be [[tailored to diverse audiences|truth and uptake]]\n!!!!--Diana T. Meyers, //Subjection and Subjectivity// (1994)\n----\n!!Not only a person’s  self-conception as  expressed in her principles and ideals but also her binding commitments and motives, not only her capacity to take an impartial or altruistic standpoint, but also ''patterns of salience in perception and imagination'', specific categorial frames for organizing experience, ''posture and tone'' of voice, a sense of ''timing and tact'' — all  these and more — are engaged in and presupposed by active morality. \n!!!!--Amelie Oksensberg Rorty, &quot;What it Takes to Be Good&quot; in Noam &amp; Wren, ed., //The Moral Self// (1992)\n!!''Moral advance'' consists ''not in'' adapting individual natures to the ''fixed realities'' of a moral universe, but in constantly reconstructing and [[recreating the world as the individuals evolve|diachronic ethics]].  \n!!!!-- G.H. Mead, &quot;The Philosophical Basis of Ethics&quot;\n!!''There is no virtue'' which is final; all are initial... The terror of reform is the ''discovery'' that we must cast away our virtues, or ''what we have always esteemed'' such, into the same pit that has consumed our grosser vices: — “Forgive his crimes, forgive his virtues too, / Those smaller faults, half converts to the right” \n!!!!--Ralph Waldo Emerson, &quot;Circles&quot;\n----\n!!The legacy of harm is that we are ''alienated'' from our understanding of ourselves as moral beings, and from each other.... We become resistant and/or paralyzed because we experience the side effects of the ''incoherence'' of the modern concept of responsibility.\n!!!!--Barbara Houston, &quot;Taking Responsibility&quot; (//Philosophy of Education//, 2002)\n!!Feminists’ interest in question of [[responsibility]] should extend beyond a simply ''intellectual curiosity'' that can be satisfied by achieving ''accurate moral judgments'' regarding the party or parties responsible for harmful states of affairs.\n!!!!--Alison Bailey, &quot;Taking Responsibility for Community Violence&quot;  (~DesAutels &amp; Waugh, 201)\n!!People... express their understandings through ''practices of [[responsibility]]'' in which they assign, accept, or deflect responsibilities for different things… Practices of responsibility are ''constructive''; they may reproduce existing terms of recognition or they may shift them.\n!!!!--Margaret Urban Walker, //Moral Understandings// (1998)\n----\n!!It is ... a [[mistake to separate|ecological theory]] the cultural environment from the natural environment, as if there were a world of ''mental'' products distinct from the world of ''material'' products. ''There is only one world'', however diverse, and all animals live in it, although we human animals have ''altered'' it to suit ourselves. We have done so wastefully, ''thoughtlessly'', and, if we do not mend our ways, fatally.\n!!!!--J.J. Gibson, //The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception//, 1979\n!!Because our ''conceptual systems'' grow out of our bodies, meaning is ''grounded in and though our bodies''. Because a vast range of our concepts are [[metaphorical|metaphors]], meaning is ''not entirely literal'' and the classical correspondence theory of truth is false. ... That does not mean that truth is purely subjective... Rather, our [[common embodidiment|social affordances]] allows for common, ''stable truths''.\n!!!!-- Lakoff and Johnson, //Philosophy in the Flesh// 1999\n----\n!!We have learned ... to approach scientific problems ... ''by ignoring'' — or postponing consideration of — the possibility that ''the larger context'' may influence the smaller... Our hypothesis runs counter to this... The [[observer must be included|responsibility]] within the focus of observation, and what can be studied is always a ''relationship'' or an infinite regress of relationships. Never a “thing”.\n!!!!--Gregory Bateson, //Steps to an Ecology of Mind//, 1972\n!!The impact on me of realizing that our histories as agents are ''webs'' in which all that is a ''product of our wills'' is supported by things that are ''not'' is an //ethical// impact. It moves me toward humility and mercy, virtues that acknowledge the unfairness of life but also presuppose a morally structured context... [[responsibility]] is an achievement, not a given.\n!!!!--Claudia Card, //The Unnatural Lottery//, 1996\n----\n!!''Hatred of'' [[evil]] is itself a kind of bondage to evil... resistance if it is to be ''effective'' in preventing the spread of evil should be combined with the greatest degree of [[understanding|moral understanding]] and the smallest degree of force that is compatible with the ''survival of the good'' things that we wish to preserve. \n!!!!--Bertrand Russell, &quot;Knowledge and Wisdom&quot;\n!!''Relativists'' often see their view as conducive to ''respect''. But relativism isnt necessary or sufficient for respect, and the mere expression of [[moral criticism|critical virtue]] should not be conflated with violence or coercion.'' \n!!!!--Michele Moody–Adams, //Fieldwork in Familiar Places//\n</div>

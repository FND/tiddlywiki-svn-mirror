Principles and theory emerge as important ''interventions'' and mark the tentative resting-points of critical dialogue, rather than serving as ultimate foundations of judgment. In this light, moral  theory is a form of moral practice, and our attention should shift from static models of justification to situated practices of critical engagement. \n!How to represent what we encounter (including how to represent what others say) is, on this view, an immediate and pervasive ''practical question''. Alas, ingredients that if combined would add up to truth do not necessarily mix well together in hard cases. A broadly [[pragmatist account]] of [[representation]] helps show how the best critical representations in one circumstance may be inappropriate in others. Nevertheless, the skills and sensitivities involved in [[critical virtue]] are difficult achievements open to careful exploration.\n</div>

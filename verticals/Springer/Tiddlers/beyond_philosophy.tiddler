<div tiddler="beyond philosophy" modifier="YourName" modified="200603181919" created="200512111535" tags="">In addition to teaching and writing in philosophy, I tinker with [[teaching technology]] and FileMakerPro databases. Out of concern for the effects of computer use on the body, I recommend [[Alexander Technique|http://ergonomics.org/articles/atoverview/]], the [[Dvorak keyboard]] and other ergonomic tools. \n!I also enjoy [[commuting by bicycle|http://www.ceejbot.com/Meta/bike.commuting.php]], practicing [[Tai Chi|http://www.hunyuantaiji.org/]], and sponsoring Wesleyan's [[Go club]], and studying Japanese [[shakuhachi]] music. My [[iTunes music collection|music library access]] can be browsed by Wesleyan network users.\n!(However, if you read [[bicycling &amp; moral priorities]], you might wonder whether I ever get very far [[beyond philosophy]] after all...)\n----\n[img[snowball|images/snowball.gif]]</div>

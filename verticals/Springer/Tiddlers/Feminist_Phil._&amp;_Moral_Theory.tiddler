<div tiddler="Feminist Phil. &amp; Moral Theory" modifier="ESpringer" modified="200511192226" created="200511192226" tags="courses">This course explores the [[dialogue]] between feminist concerns and moral theory, revisiting along the way what might count as &quot;a feminist concern&quot;. After a brief review of several canonical moral theories, we will ask whether their language (reason, fairness, equality, utility, human nature, rights) sufficiently allows articulation of feminist problems. If gender categories and intersecting deep social identities have resiliently resisted moral scrutiny, can distinctively feminist contributions to moral theory provide better critical tools? \n!On one hand, we will evaluate attempts to ''synthesize'' feminist criticism with canonical moral ideas from Aristotle, Confucius, Hume, Kant, Marx, and Mill, as well as Gilligan's and Noddings' care-based analyses of moral interaction. On the other hand, some recent feminists have ''questioned the point'' and function of moral theorizing in response to oppression: does the very idea of moral judgment involve arrogance or objectification? We examine how critical inquiry about gender inspires deep questions about moral theory for authors such as bell hooks, Marilyn Frye, Maria Lugones, Sarah Lucia Hoagland, Margaret Walker, and Susan Babbitt, among others.\n!This course, ''PHIL/WMST 277'', will serve as a Gateway course for the [[WMST / FG&amp;S Studies|http://www.wesleyan.edu/wmst/]] major.</div>

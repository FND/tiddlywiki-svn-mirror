<div tiddler="metaphors" modifier="ESpringer" modified="200508042117" created="200508042117" tags="">The ''distinction'' between the literal and the metaphorical is surely ''a matter of degree'', no matter how much analytic philosophers seek to &quot;tell it like it is&quot; with no rhetorical interference. Emerson and Nietzsche both suggest that a historical process of use wears metaphors down into &quot;common currency&quot;, but that our language is saturated with imagery whose origins are metaphorical. \n!In their [[book|http://print.google.com/print?id=44PaTg1rC2gC&amp;lpg=91&amp;prev=http://print.google.com/print%3Fq%3Dlakoff%2Bjohnson%2Bmetaphors%26btnG%3DSearch%2BPrint&amp;sig=IERDhcSrpsV3CkKIfZPeB9g5Kgs]], //Metaphors We Live By//, [[Mark Johnson|http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~uophil/faculty/mjohnson/mjohnson.html]] and [[George Lakoff|http://www.linguistics.berkeley.edu/lingdept/Current/people/facpages/lakoffg.html]] investigate how metaphors from &quot;basic&quot; domains of practical interaction function pervasively to structure our more abstract concepts.</div>

<div tiddler="•••On Representation" modifier="ESpringer" modified="200508041959" created="200508041959" tags="">From a moral agent's point of view: what [[Understanding(s)]] of moral [[representation]] not only &quot;fits&quot; our practices of ascribing truth, but actually offers insight into how to improve our relation to it -- that is, how to represent moral phenomena more wisely? About representation, Rorty writes, \n&lt;&lt;&lt;\n[I]t is not likely that there is something general and useful to be said about... the common feature of all the sentences which one should acquire a disposition to assert. [//Consequences of Pragmatism, xiii//]\n&lt;&lt;&lt;\nThis is on the right track, but the deflationary tone seems misleading. After all, to the extent we //have// had certain guiding attitudes about &quot;what is to be said,&quot; (such as propositional consistency) becoming aware of the //conditions under which// those assumptions make sense enables us to recognize their limits, and thus to change our practice for the better... For example, something might be said about the difference between sentences which are good for //anyone// (or nearly anyone) to assert, and those which make sense only for a small range of situated speakers.</div>

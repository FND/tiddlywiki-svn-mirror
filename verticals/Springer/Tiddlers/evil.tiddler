<div tiddler="evil" modifier="Elise Springer" modified="200511181613" created="200511181613" tags="concepts">If moral philosophers approach 'evil' as a ''property'', we find ourselves soon entangled in awkward metaphysical debates and theoretical standoffs.\n!However, if we begin by asking about ''what stance'' is invoked by ''[[representation]] of evil'', we may make further progress. Nietzsche is right at least that the [[representation]] of evil has both a history and a purpose, and that reality takes new shapes as our language evolves. This remains so even if Nietzsche's dismissal of suffering serves at best the functions of [[irony]] and [[provocation|moral provocation]]. \n!If representations of evil invoke a certain stance, there may well be ''cases in which it is good'' to take such a stance, and hence such representation may be reasonable in context. For example, it may be reasonable (not just a lie, but accurate, in context) to represent some things as evil to ''children'', as they may otherwise be too optimistic about their ability to create shared understandings with treacherously vicious people. Still, we should hope that ''psychologists'' and clergymembers resist thinking of those who seek their help as ''evil''; to intervene constructively with anyone's attitudes requires a [[principle of charity]].\n!Still, even if a [[principle of charity]] figures into an ideal critic's moral understanding, we cannot know a priori that [[critical virtue]] would //never// in practice involve representing something as evil. Critics and their audiences are limited beings with finite resources for [[moral understanding]], and representations occur in all sorts of non-ideal situations.\n!Yet an emphasis on the ''practice'' of representing-as-evil makes it more doubtful that there is any being or event which ''everyone'' ought to represent-as-evil, across contexts.</div>

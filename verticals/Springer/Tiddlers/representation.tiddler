<div tiddler="representation" modifier="ESpringer" modified="200508091729" created="200508091729" tags="">Representation, according to pragmatists, is always situated and directed, and is meaningful only because of its uptake in interpretation and use.  (One hears talk of pragmatist &quot;anti-representationalism,&quot; but the word 'representation' is best recovered rather than discarded, I believe.)\n!\nWhile [[C. S. Peirce]]'s approach to representation emphasizes how we work towards convergence in meanings and in habits of interpretative use, [[William James]] tends to emphasize divergence and individuality in the present. \n!\nOn my view, the tension between these points is not a simple disagreement; we have much to learn about the ''degree'' to which various concepts -- pragmatically understood -- can yield to ''social convergence'' pressures. There may not be one account of what makes things good to say (and hence true), but we may do fruitful investigation into the details that make some claims serve as broadly exchange-worthy propositions, while others remain only locally useful. \n!\nIn other words, all representations are more or less shared [[social affordances]] (see also [[affordance articles]]). So, in the context of moral cricticism, we should expect that only experience can teach how well a moral concept (like [[responsibility]], [[evil]], or admirability) can serve as a stable reference-point in different interactions.\n!\nSee also [[realism debates]]</div>

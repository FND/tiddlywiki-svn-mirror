<div tiddler="Critical Responsibilities" modifier="ESpringer" modified="200603161755" created="200603161755" tags="research">//Critical Responsibilities// contributes to moral philosophy by examining how criticism of others fits into moral responsibility. The text begins by illustrating how moral criticism develops within dynamic social interactions, serving in some cases to spur change and in other cases to polarize conflict through critical resistance. Because criticism is both essential and volatile, neither a simple appeal to critical honesty nor a wholesale renunciation of criticism is compatible with moral responsibility. Consequently, moral philosophy needs an account of wise and unwise critical practices. \n!At the same time, the deeply social nature of problem-solving requires moral philosophers to rethink our models of responsibility, which have tended to focus exclusively on individual deeds and commitments. An ecological model of responsibility illuminates what role a competence in moral criticism plays in moral life. \n!The book is primarily addressed towards moral philosophers, but as participants in the moral universe rather than as its cool spectators or taxonomists. An unusual aspect of the text is that the writing of moral theory is framed as itself an engagement of critical responsibility.</div>

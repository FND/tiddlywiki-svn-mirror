<div tiddler="truth and uptake" modifier="Elise Springer" modified="200509150021" created="200509150021" tags="">Must a true claim express a proposition with audience-neutral content? For some concepts, there may not be anything like audience-neutral [[representation]] to be had. That is, the very notion of ''meaning'' may represent an ideal that is approached better by some concepts (and in some contexts) than by others. When our claims touch upon the unstable domain of [[social affordances]], for example, the notion that there is one audience-neutral claim, one circulable bit of content one //really means//, may break down.\n!\nEspecially in connection with [[metaphor|metaphors]], we face a range of possible situations: for some audiences, a metaphor will be [[precarious]]; for others, it is so stable as to have become &quot;dead&quot; or literal. In yet other contexts, a divergence in likely audience uptake invites irony. Yet the hope that we could simply avoid metaphor and irony -- and hence avoid having to attend to audience uptake -- is empty.</div>

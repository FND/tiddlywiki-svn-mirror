<div tiddler="colleagues" modifier="ESpringer" modified="200511180838" created="200511180838" tags="Research">I have been pleased to find intersections between my work and that of [[colleagues at Wesleyan Philosophy Dept.|http://www.wesleyan.edu/phil]] ([[pictured here|faculty photo]]): ''[[Steven Angle|http://sangle.web.wesleyan.edu/]]'' has done considerable thinking about moral teaching and matters of interpretation especially in relation to Chinese philosophy; ''Brian Fay'' has worked on Spinoza and on ideas of the Self;  ''[[Lori Gruen|http://www.wesleyan.edu/templates/dept/phil/skeleton_faculty.htt/?function=f1&amp;department=PHIL&amp;faculty=lgruen]]'' works on practical ethics with an interest in feminist ethics and phenomena of moral alienation; ''[[Steven Horst|http://shorst.web.wesleyan.edu/]]'' is interested in moral psychology as well as naturalisms; ''Mary- Hannah Jones'' has worked on class Greek ideas of moral psychology including the elusive Socratic virtues; ''Joe Rouse'' has been developing accounts of intersubjectivity and social practices of inquiry and representation; even our logician and philosopher and language ''[[Sanford Shieh|http://sshieh.web.wesleyan.edu/]]'' shares at least some of my appreciation of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]. \n!In addition, many colleagues now at other instutitions have had a personal or deep professional influence upon my work. ''[[Terry Winant|http://zimmer.csufresno.edu/~terryw/]]'', ''Ruth Ginzburg'', and ''[[Diana Meyers|http://vm.uconn.edu/~wwwphil/meyerscv.htm]]'' sparked my interest in philosophy and introduced me to feminist and political philosophy. ''Joel J. Kupperman'' first encouraged my pursuit of moral theory, while ''[[Ruth Millikan|http://vm.uconn.edu/~wwwphil/millikan.htm]]'' and ''Garry Brodsky'' helped to shape the naturalist and pragmatist elements that have emerged. Extended conversations and exchanges with ''David Slutsky'', ''Keya Maitra'', ''Joel Kupfer'', ''Michael Stocker'', ''[[Tamar Gendler|http://people.cornell.edu/pages/tsg3/]]'', ''Stan Konecky'', ''Todd Lekan'', ''[[Gunnar Bjornsson|http://people.su.se/~gbjorn/eng.html]]'', and many others have shaped the project in early stages. \n</div>

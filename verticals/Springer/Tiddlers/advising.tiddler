<div tiddler="advising" modifier="ESpringer" modified="200512111850" created="200512111850" tags="teaching">!!!Class of 2008:    \nBesides pursuing particular classes and activities, Class of 2008 advisees are working towards [[declaring a major|http://www.wesleyan.edu/deans/major_declaration]] (by March 3), and should browse through [[frequently-asked questions|http://www.wesleyan.edu/deans/major_declaration/FAQ.htm]] about the process, and consult with [[advising experts for departments|http://www.wesleyan.edu/deans/major_declaration/chairs_advisors.htm]] that might offer a good fit for you. \n!By the end of this year, Wesleyan expects that you will have sampled at least a couple courses from each division (HA/SBS/NSM), and by April 30 you need to submit [[paperwork|http://www.wesleyan.edu/deans/forms.html]] confirming that you've met the expectation or offering a rationale for your decision not to do so. This year is also a good interval in which to [[think about studying abroad|http://www.wesleyan.edu/ois/]] and to visit the [[Career Resource Center|http://www.wesleyan.edu/crc/]].\n\n!!!Philosophy Majors:    \nJunior and senior majors should be familiar with the philosophy department's [[expectations|http://www.wesleyan.edu/phil/Major_Program.html]]. For ''juniors'', one less obvious point of concern is putting in place any key background coursework if you plan on doing an honors ''thesis'' during senior year. At the end of junior year, those planning to work on thesis projects should submit a form declaring intent and describing the project and a likely match for faculty supervision. For ''seniors'', a point of extra concern is not to take for granted that you will get into required courses or get paperwork deadlines waived //simply in virtue of// being a senior. Make sure to plan ahead, be prompt in getting permission of instructor forms before pre-registration, and check in with professors who are offering the courses that stand between you and finishing on time. Double-majors should be especially careful to check the course catalog early to troubleshoot conflicts between required courses in different fields.</div>

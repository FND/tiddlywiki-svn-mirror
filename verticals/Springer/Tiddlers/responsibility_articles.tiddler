I was surprised not to see more focus on the social conditions under which such capacities are best cultivated; the predominant image was of the unfolding of innate tendencies (plausibly claimed to be absent in sociopaths).\n!\n''John Martin Fischer, &quot;Responsibility, History and Manipulation&quot;'' (//Journal of Ethics//, 2000)\n!!This article takes the more analytic approach to [[responsibility]] (discussing it in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions). While its appeal to the history of the agent is refreshing, I think we should resist his suggestion that the crucial factor behind responsibility is a set subjective beliefs about the sources of act in question.\n!\n''Barbara Houston, &quot;Taking Responsibility&quot;'' (//Philosophy of Education//, 2002)\n!!In this article on responsibility, Houston does what I'd hope to see us all do: she takes responsibility for how philosophical ideas are ''taken up in practice''. The &quot;default&quot; or &quot;modern&quot; conception of responsibility, Houston argues, is incoherent in a way that makes people less likely to take responsibility for addressing diffuse and historical social problems. She urges a clearer sense of the ''autonomy'' involved in taking responsibility. Her clear distinction between forward-looking and backward-looking is exhilirating in a sort of existentialist vein, if not altogether convincing...\n!\n''Rebecca Kukla, &quot;The Ontology and Temporality of Conscience&quot;'' (//Continental Phil. Review// 2002)\n!!An discussion of whether we can explain the conditions under which &quot;the call of conscience&quot; acquires normative force. Kukla concludes, through a persuasive reading of Heidegger, that normative force must experienced as &quot;always already&quot; a demand, not traceable to any specific originary moment. She also recognizes two aspects to the nature of [[responsibility]].\n!\n''Michael Schwalbe, &quot;Toward a Sociology of Moral Problem Solving&quot;'' (//Journal for the Theory of Social Behavior//, 1990)\n!!An argument for researching not only about the cognitive capacities that enable moral role-taking, but also about the societal conditions that foster the development and use of these abilities. Suggest's [[G.H. Mead]]'s approach as helpful in thinking about these dimensions.\n</div>

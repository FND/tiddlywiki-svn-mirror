<div tiddler="TiddlyWiki" modifier="YourName" modified="200511191955" created="200511191955" tags="technology">This site is based on [[TiddlyWiki|http://www.osmosoft.com]], whose author, Jeremy Ruston, writes:\n&lt;&lt;&lt;\nTiddlyWiki is like a blog because it's divided up into neat little chunks, but it encourages you to read it by hyperlinking rather than sequentially... TiddlyWiki represents a novel medium for writing, and will promote its own distinctive Writing Style.\n&lt;&lt;&lt;\n!See the [[site explanation]] for more details on ''how to browse'' the site. From the author's point of view, TiddlyWiki has the advantage of being editable spontaneously, directly within a web browser (though on standard TiddlyWiki sites, edit functions have no effect over the web). I would be happy to field comments via [[email|mailto:espringer@wesleyan.edu]] from any visitors.\n!Wiki-style coding also underlies the student collaboration sites for my classes. I'm currently using [[ZiddlyWiki|http://www.ziddlywiki.org]], but also can recommend the somewhat more basic [[courseforum|http://www.courseforum.com]] tool.

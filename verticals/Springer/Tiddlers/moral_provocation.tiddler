<div tiddler="moral provocation" modifier="ESpringer" modified="200511181619" created="200511181619" tags="">&quot;Moral provocation&quot; is whatever moves us to engage in criticism. Such a phrase helps to indicate a certain open-textured experience: \n!If I say I &quot;witnessed wrongdoing&quot; or &quot;learned of an action that seemed wrong&quot;, I probably settle quite quickly on a description of what it is that happened, and focus attention entirely on deciding the status of that event, described in that way. In hard cases, however, the sense that ''something'' is wrong is the starting point, and further specification of ''what was wrong'' emerges in a process of [[dialogue]], reflection, and cumulative perspective over time. \n!To be a wise moral critic (one with [[critical virtue]]) requires more than fixing attention on some X (say, abortion or military action) and deciding whether it is morally permissible. The further element required is the abiity to attend to each morally [[problematic situation]], and to reflect on its ingredients along with the most constructive attitude to take towards them. \n!A moral provocation, as such, is a ''particular encounter'' with a problem, relative to which we have different resources and different perceptual talents. Given a particular situation, the most constructive attitude to take may vary according to our different characters and social positions, as well. </div>

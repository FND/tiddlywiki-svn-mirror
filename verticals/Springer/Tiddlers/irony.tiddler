<div tiddler="irony" modifier="Elise Springer" modified="200603191910" created="200508011822" tags="concepts">Although &quot;irony&quot; tends to suggest &quot;sarcasm&quot; and &quot;insincerity&quot; in popular use, philosophical irony is a much more subtle attitude. Whenever one speaks with attention to how multiple audiences would take one's words in entirely divergent directions, there is fertile ground for irony. If [[G.H. Mead]] is right that relatively consistent social uptake is necessary for us to understand &quot;the meaning&quot; of our own words (See [[vs. Meaning rationalism]]), then the ironist may be in a position not of &quot;insincerity&quot;, but rather of not having avaliable any relevant utterance that one //could// &quot;really mean&quot;, independent of audience and context.\n!Because [[critical virtue]] is most evident in its handling of hard cases, and because hard cases are characterized by broad differences of perspective, I believe the wise moral critic will often employ what amounts to irony. We find there to be no single &quot;sincere meaning&quot; to some crucial utterances by Socrates, by Confucius, and indeed by the [[feminist social critics|quotes.html#%5B%5Bfeminist%20social%20critics*%5D%5D]] discussed by Cheshire Calhoun and Ruth Bleier. Deeply related to irony is the appearance of ''lack of integrity'' on the part of those whose meanings cannot be uniformly understood, for they must, as Diana Meyers notes, address different audiences with different communicative strategies:\n!&lt;&lt;tiddler MeyersOnDissidentSpeech&gt;&gt;</div>

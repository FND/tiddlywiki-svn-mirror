<pre>Within the main story column you can click on bold links to read a linked tiddler. Click on italic links to create a new tiddler. When you hover the mouse over a tiddler several ToolbarButtons appear. You can edit the text of any tiddler by double-clicking on it (or selecting 'edit' from the toolbar), but your changes won't get saved permanently until you make your own copy of TiddlyWiki, as described in SaveChanges.</pre>

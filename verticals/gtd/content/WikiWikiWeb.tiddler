<pre>A Wiki is a popular way of building collaborative websites. It's based on the ideas of easy editing of pages and the use of special WikiWord notation to automagically create links between pages. See Wikipedia for [[more details|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki]]. TiddlyWiki is different from a conventional Wiki because it is not based on entire pages of content, but rather items of MicroContent that are referred to as 'tiddlers'.</pre>

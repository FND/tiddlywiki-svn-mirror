<pre>Welcome to the GTDTiddlyWiki, an experimental MicroContent WikiWikiWeb originally built by JeremyRuston and adapted for GTD use by NathanBowers. It's written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript to run on any modern browser without needing any ServerSide logic. It allows anyone to create personal SelfContained hypertext documents that can be posted to any web server, sent by email or kept on a USB thumb drive to make a WikiOnAStick.</pre>

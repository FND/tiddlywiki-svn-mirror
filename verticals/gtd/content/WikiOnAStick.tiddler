<pre>Putting TiddlyWiki on a USB thumb drive lets you carry around a SelfContained notebook that you can update wherever there's a reasonably modern computer, whether it's a Mac, Linux or a PC. (To be even more independent you can [[install FireFox on the drive|http://www.mozilla.org/support/firefox/tips#oth_usb]] as well).</pre>

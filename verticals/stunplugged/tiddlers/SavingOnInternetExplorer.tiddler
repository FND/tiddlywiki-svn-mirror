<div tiddler="SavingOnInternetExplorer" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200611081356" created="200611081337" tags="" changecount="2">You can save changes with Internet Explorer versions 6 and 7, but not the earlier versions. The procedure is:\n# Click the button labelled 'save changes' over in the right hand sidebar\n# If prompted as follows, click &quot;Yes&quot;:\n## &quot;An ActiveX control on this page might be unsafe to interact with other parts of the page. Do you want to allow this interaction?&quot;\n# You should then see a message at the top right of the window saying &quot;Main TiddlyWiki file saved&quot;\nNote that there is currently [[a bug|http://trac.tiddlywiki.org/tiddlywiki/ticket/39]] that prevents Internet Explorer from saving correctly if you have specified a backup directory in AdvancedOptions.</div>

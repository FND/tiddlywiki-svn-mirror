<pre>Socialtext Unplugged lets you browse and edit your content while you're offline. When you make a change you need to SaveChanges to save the change to your local hard drive, before later performing a SyncChanges to synchronise the change back to the server.

The procedure for SaveChanges is slightly different for different browsers:
* SavingOnInternetExplorer
* SavingOnFireFox
* SavingOnSafari
* SavingOnOpera</pre>

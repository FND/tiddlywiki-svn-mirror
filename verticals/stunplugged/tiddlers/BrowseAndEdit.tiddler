<div tiddler="BrowseAndEdit" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200611081457" created="200611081454" tags="excludeLists excludeSearch">In Socialtext Unplugged, the selected pages of your Socialtext workspace are displayed as individual &quot;tiddlers&quot; on the page. When the mouse passes over a tiddler a short toolbar menu appears at the top right. Use the commands here to manipulate that particular tiddler: notably closing and editting it. (You can double click on a tiddler as a shortcut to directly enter edit mode).\n\nOver on the right hand side of the window are commands that affect the entire page, in particular &quot;close all&quot; which can be useful to clear the decks when many tiddlers are open at once.\n\nThe user is encouraged to ensure that they can SaveChanges before embarking on widespread editing.</div>

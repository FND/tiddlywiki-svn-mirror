<pre>In Socialtext Unplugged, the selected pages of your Socialtext workspace are displayed as individual &quot;tiddlers&quot; on the page. When the mouse passes over a tiddler a short toolbar menu appears at the top right. Use the commands here to manipulate that particular tiddler: notably closing and editting it. (You can double click on a tiddler as a shortcut to directly enter edit mode).

Over on the right hand side of the window are commands that affect the entire page, in particular &quot;close all&quot; which can be useful to clear the decks when many tiddlers are open at once.

The user is encouraged to ensure that they can SaveChanges before embarking on widespread editing.</pre>

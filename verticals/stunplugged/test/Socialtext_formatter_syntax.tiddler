<pre>Up: [Socialtext Links and WAFLs - Summary]

This is a list of formatting syntax that is _not_ wafl.

^^^ Things considered blocks

* headers
** `^`
** `^^`
** `^^^`
** `^^^^`
* paragraphs (text separated by two line feeds, not otherwise made special)

**This is a lovely and exciting paragraph of meaningless text, which was generated for testing purposes. There should be whitespace lines before and after this cute little test paragraph. If there are not, something has gone wierd and all the text is being scrunched together.

Only one whitespace line should appear after this chunk of text, despite the fact that i gave it five empty lines while editing in Advanced mode. More than 2 line feeds are not recognized.

* indent/blockquote with `&gt;` at beginning of paragraph

`&gt;`
`&gt;&gt;`
`&gt;&gt;&gt;`

&gt; level one indent
&gt;&gt; level two indent
&gt;&gt;&gt; level three indent


* list items `*` `#` etc

* B 1
** B 1.1
* B 2
** B 2.1
*** B 2.1.1
*** B 2.1.2

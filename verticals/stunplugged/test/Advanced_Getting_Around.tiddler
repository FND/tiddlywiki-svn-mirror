<pre>Up: [Workspace Tour - Table of Contents]
Back: [How do I find my way around?]

Here are some more advanced workspace navigation techniques. If you like, you can go back to the basic page, called [How do I find my way around?]

You can use [categories] to group pages that are related. Anyone can put a page into a category by editing the page and using the category controls. Then, you can find pages in a given category by clicking on the *&quot;Categories&quot;* link in the top menu.

You can also customize your navigation with the [navigation sidebar]. Click on *&quot;Settings&quot;* in the top menu, and you can add sidebar boxes that show you the pages you've been to recently, pages that have been recently changed, and your own set of favorite pages.

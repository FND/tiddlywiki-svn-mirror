<pre>You can save changes with Internet Explorer versions 6 and 7, but not the earlier versions. The procedure is:
# Click the button labelled 'save changes' over in the right hand sidebar
# If prompted as follows, click "Yes":
## "An ActiveX control on this page might be unsafe to interact with other parts of the page. Do you want to allow this interaction?"
# You should then see a message at the top right of the window saying "Main TiddlyWiki file saved"
Note that there is currently [[a bug|http://trac.tiddlywiki.org/tiddlywiki/ticket/39]] that prevents Internet Explorer from saving correctly if you have specified a backup directory in AdvancedOptions.</pre>

<div title="Save Changes" modifier="SaqImtiaz" created="200712031346" modified="200712031542">
<pre>When you make a change you need to 'save changes' (in the menu to the right) to save the change to your local hard drive, before later performing a <<backstage sync>> to synchronise the change back to the server.

The procedure for saving changes is slightly different for different browsers:
* SavingOnInternetExplorer
* SavingOnFireFox
* SavingOnSafari
* SavingOnOpera</pre>

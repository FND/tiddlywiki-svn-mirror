<div tiddler="NanoCo" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200601180708" created="200601180659" tags="concepts">A NanoCo is a teeny-tiny one-person company (it's the company that's small, of course, not the person).  Compared to a BigCo like Yahoo, or even a SmallCo like 37Signals, a NanoCo is wafer thin, but the combination of the web and open source can smooth out the  differences.</div>

<div tiddler="10 November 2005" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200511091624" created="200511091624" tags="news">[[Revision 1.2.38]] is a minor revision of TiddlyWiki that just addresses an issue with [[Safari]]. The next major release, [[Revision 1.2.39]], has just entered beta at http://www.tiddlywiki.com/beta/\n\nThere is a [[serious bug|http://bugzilla.opendarwin.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5597]] in the latest version 2.0.2 of [[Safari]] that stops it working properly with recent versions of TiddlyWiki (Safari 2.0.2 was delivered as part of the recent OS X 10.4.3 update, and so will affect most Mac users). This new revision of TiddlyWiki introduces a kludgy workaround for the bug by disabling the use of the Unicode characters Ő (0x0150), ő (0x0151), Ű (0x0170) and ű (0x0171) within a WikiWord for affected versions of Safari. (Note that these characters can still be used in PrettyLinks).\n\nIn other news, I've added a couple of great new TiddlyWikiExamples. There's also an adaptation of the [[Crawford Slip Writing Method|http://billbrantley.com/twCrawford.htm]] using TiddlyWiki that has recently been published. It's an interesting way of recording ideas generated by a large group of people at the same time. </div>

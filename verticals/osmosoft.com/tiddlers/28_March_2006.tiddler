The [[call for proposals|http://blogtalk.net/call.html]] is over on April 1st, so if you'd like to take part you'll have to hurry.\n\nWill Backman has published a podcast [[interview with me|http://bsdtalk.blogspot.com/2006/03/bsdtalk024-interview-with-tiddlywiki.html]] for [[BSDTalk|http://bsdtalk.blogspot.com]]. We talked about TiddlyWiki, and why I chose the BSD license for it. It was only when we were chatting afterwards that I clocked that I use BSD software everyday - Mac OS X incorporates chunks of OpenBSD.</div>

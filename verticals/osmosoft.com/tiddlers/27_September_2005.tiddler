<div tiddler="27 September 2005" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200509261548" created="200509261548" tags="news">This is a new revision of TiddlyWiki with several big changes under the hood and some NewFeatures. Because of some KnownBugs, there's likely to be further revisions over the next few days knocking some of the rough edges off, so be sure to check back here for updates if you run into any problems.\n\nThe first change is an organisational one: I've moved all the technical, developer-ish material to a new [[TiddlyWiki/Dev]] site. The aim is to keep this main site as a clean reference for end-users of TiddlyWiki. NewFeatures include this GradientMacro, InlineHTML, improved ExtendedFormatting, more options for EmbeddedImages and the ability to SaveChanges on [[Opera]].\n\nBack in August, JeremyWagstaff wrote an [[article|http://groups.google.com/group/TiddlyWiki/browse_thread/thread/53c7b7686b9bb5c2/122f1b2146d2ba6d?q=wsj&amp;rnum=1&amp;hl=en#122f1b2146d2ba6d]] about TiddlyWiki on WSJ.com. Jeremy has also published on his blog his background interviews with [[JonnyLeRoy|http://loosewire.typepad.com/blog/2005/08/the_tiddlywiki_.html]], [[ClintChecketts|http://loosewire.typepad.com/blog/2005/08/the_tiddlywiki__1.html]], [[AlanHecht|http://loosewire.typepad.com/blog/2005/08/the_tiddlywiki__2.html]] and [[me|http://loosewire.typepad.com/blog/2005/08/the_tiddlywiki__3.html]].\n\nThere's been plenty of activity around TiddlyWiki. ClintChecketts has published a skin based on Wikipedia called, inevitably, [[TiddlyPedia|http://15black.bluedepot.com/styles/tiddlypedia.htm]]. JoshGoebel has launched [[ServerSideWiki|http://www.serversidewiki.com]], a hosted adaptation of TiddlyWiki with a Ruby on Rails ServerSide. KenMusante has published [[TiddlyBlogger|http://www.tiddlyblogger.blogspot.com/]] an experimental adaptation of TiddlyWiki as a template for Blogger. Rich Kulesus has skinned TiddlyWiki beautifully to produce his [[themer's blog|http://www.skinyourscreen.com/mrbiotech/]] related to skinning a Windows program called LiteStep. As he says, you &quot;almost wouldn't know it was TiddlyWiki&quot;.\n\nThere are new TiddlyWiki &lt;&lt;tag translations&gt;&gt; for [[Finnish]] and [[Polish]], and I'd love to hear of any others I've left out.\n</div>

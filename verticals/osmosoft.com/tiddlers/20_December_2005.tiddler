<div tiddler="20 December 2005" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200512210200" created="200512210200" tags="">TiddlyWiki 2.0 is now nearing it's final beta at http://www.tiddlywiki.com/beta/. Check it out to see where TiddlyWiki is going next.\n\nI only just realised that I've never linked to KeithHodges' [[TiddlyPom|http://www.warwick.ac.uk/~tuspam/tiddlypom.html]]. It's a fascinating adaptation of TiddlyWiki to become a platform for powerful programming and database applications.\n\nPaoloSoares has released his SlideShowPlugin http://www.math.ist.utl.pt/~psoares/slideshow.html that provides TiddlyWiki with similar features to EricMeyer's [[S5 slideshow|http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/]]. UdoBorkowski has revised his popular forEachTiddler macro at [[abegoExtensions|http://tiddlywiki.abego-software.de/#ForEachTiddlerPlugin]].\n\nDevonJones has kindly set up a 'Docs' area on his [[TiddlyForge|http://www.tiddlyforge.net/docs/]] to:\n&lt;&lt;&lt;\nstore documentation for TiddlyWiki for both users and developers.  It is open to the world currently, so anyone can add any thoughts they think will be helpful to the rest of the tiddlywiki community.\n&lt;&lt;&lt;\nIt's already got some excellent material on [[WikOnAStick techniques|http://www.tiddlyforge.net/docs/#%5B%5BPortable%20WikiOnAStick%5D%5D]] and [[debugging plugins|http://www.tiddlyforge.net/docs/#%5B%5BDebugging%20TiddlyWiki%20Plugins%5D%5D]].</div>

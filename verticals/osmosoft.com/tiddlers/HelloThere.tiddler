<div tiddler="HelloThere" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200603290940" created="200601081428" tags="welcome">Welcome to [[Osmosoft]], the NanoCo of JeremyRuston. I'm the creator of TiddlyWiki, a reusable non-linear personal web notebook. It's a [[hugely popular|http://del.icio.us/url/9030797ebd5e53e711531344b0297de9]] (and free) tool that people are using all over the world to write, organise and publish information.\n\nThis site is my personal playground, acting something like a blog. The core will be news and opinions about TiddlyWiki, but I intend to cover other topics that interest me (yay, look out for CellularAutomata and MachineGeneratedParodies). I'll also be publishing some of my other software projects.</div>

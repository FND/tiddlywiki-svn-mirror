<div tiddler="5 January 2006" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200601050917" created="200512310229" tags="news">Finally, after over a month in beta, here's the first release of TiddlyWiki 2.0. If you've been following the beta releases, you'll know what to expect (and hopefully welcome the marked reduction in the luridness of the new colour scheme). See [[TiddlyWiki/Dev]] for a full list of changes.\n\nOne big change is behind the scenes: I'm delighted to announce that Greg Wolff at RicohInnovations has generously agreed to provide financial support for the future development of TiddlyWiki. It's going to have a tremendous impact both on me personally, and on TiddlyWiki itself, by enabling me to work nearly full-time on it -- something I've wanted to be able to do for a very long time.\n\nAs noted by [[Grand Text Auto|http://grandtextauto.gatech.edu/2005/12/30/wiktion-and-poetri/]], ChrisKlimas has used TiddlyWiki to publish his &quot;anthology of stories that react to your touch&quot; at [[Gimcrack'd|http://gimcrackd.com/]]. It's a fascinating and entertaining experiment in TiddlyWikiFiction; highly recommended.\n\nJonnyLeRoy has deservedly been causing a lot of excitement in the TiddlyWiki [[Community]] with his [[TiddlyDesktop|http://www.digitaldimsum.co.uk/tiddly/tiddlydesktop/]] plugin. It's a new layout that allows users to drag tiddlers around a desktop and resize them, like a cross between MicrosoftWindows and [[Stickies]].</div>

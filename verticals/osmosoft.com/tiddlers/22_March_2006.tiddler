<div tiddler="22 March 2006" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200603221713" created="200603221713" tags="news">I was delighted to see that ChrisKlimas has published his [[iPodize|http://gimcrackd.com/etc/src/#%5B%5BConvert%20your%20TiddlyWiki%20to%20iPod%20format%20online%5D%5D]] utility that makes it easy to transfer TiddlyWiki content to an iPod.\n\nAs JeremyWagstaff of WSJ.com has [[noted|http://www.loosewireblog.com/2006/03/mapping_your_ti.html]], DawnAhukanna has released her [[mashup of TiddlyWiki with the Hypergraph hyperbolic tree applet|http://www.aurore.eclipse.co.uk/wiki/twextensions.htm]]. It's still very much an alpha release, but could grow into a very useful addition.\n\nTiddlyWiki has been [[discovered by RussellBeattie|http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008896.html]]; it's quite funny as he bemoans his current notetaking solutions, speculates about the features he'd like to see, and then miraculously finds them in TiddlyWiki in the small hours of the morning.</div>

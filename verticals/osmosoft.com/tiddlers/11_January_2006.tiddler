<div tiddler="11 January 2006" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200601111024" created="200601110232" tags="news">This is revision 2.0.2 of TiddlyWiki, incorporating some minor bug fixes and a couple of new features - see [[TiddlyWiki/Dev]] for a full list of changes.\n\nThere's an interesting post over at [[Exceler8ion|http://www.exceler8ion.com/]] called [[&quot;You Don't Know TiddlyWiki&quot;|http://www.exceler8ion.com/2006/01/10/you-dont-know-tiddlywiki/]] that includes these ruminations on the trend towards microcontent:\n&lt;&lt;&lt;\nAlmost everything we do in our information economy jobs is about microcontent. We don’t write papers in business anymore, we don’t do full research studies, we guestimate 95% of the time, we don’t often run fully integrated advertising campaigns, and we don’t watch all of the TV show. We don’t usually digest much of anything these days in huge gulps other than stress. Instead we take sips from a thousand different wine glasses each day and swirl the wine around in our mouths trying to identify the ingredients so we can understand them, appreciate them, and find out which ones are worth swallowing.\n&lt;&lt;&lt;\n</div>

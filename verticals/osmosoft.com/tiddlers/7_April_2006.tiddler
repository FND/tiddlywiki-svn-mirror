<div tiddler="7 April 2006" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200605012036" created="200604031607" tags="news">I've long believed that one of the unique and valuable aspects of wikis is that they elevate hyperlinking to be part of the punctuation of writing for the web. (As opposed to HTML editors which typically relegate link creation to a sub-dialogue that risks breaking any flow in the writing process). Now here's JakobNeilsen saying the same thing so much more articulately in his [[Hyped Web Stories Are Irrelevant|http://www.useit.com/alertbox/hype.html]]:\n&lt;&lt;&lt;\nThe Wikipedia's most exciting aspect is that it's a highly interlinked hypertext. Most of the time, if you visit for one article, you end up reading five, because the richness of associative links lead you to more and more interesting information that you didn't even know you wanted. Sadly, the Web has generally lost its foundation as hypertext, and most sites offer only heavily regimented navigation that's tied into an official information architecture. Usually, there's little in the way of associative, &quot;see also&quot; links and local navigation. Wikipedia shows the benefits of reverting to the view of websites as hypertexts.\n&lt;&lt;&lt;\nAnd then he lays out what I see as the both the opportunity and the challenge for TiddlyWiki:\n&lt;&lt;&lt;\nNow, if only someone would make a Wiki solution with great usability that average people could use to author strongly interlinked hypertexts. That would be something worth almost any level of hype. The way to knock out Microsoft Office is not to reimplement its feature set from two versions ago in a different programming language. We don't need bad copies -- we need collaborative authoring of hyperspaces as opposed to linear documents.\n&lt;&lt;&lt;\n</div>

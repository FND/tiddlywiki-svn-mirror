<div tiddler="JeremyRuston" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200609291500" created="200601180702" tags="welcome">In recent years, I've been Head of eCommerce at investment bank DrKB (now [[Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein|http://www.drkw.com/]]), and CTO of two London-based ~VC-backed dotcoms, including [[Infuzer|http://www.infuzer.com]]. My main professional interests are implementing new user experience technologies and building successful engineering teams.\n\n[[Back in the 1980's|http://www.flickr.com/photos/jermy/177980048/]], I was a freelance programmer and technical writer. I wrote a series of home computer books, designed custom animations for television shows, and developed a number of shrink wrapped applications including compilers, word processors and games.\n\nI can be reached at {{{jeremy (at) osmosoft (dot) com}}}, and I regularly read and reply to messages on the [[TiddlyWiki Google Groups|Community]]. You can also find me on [[Flickr|http://www.flickr.com/photos/jermy/]] and [[del.icio.us|http://del.icio.us/jeremyruston]].</div>

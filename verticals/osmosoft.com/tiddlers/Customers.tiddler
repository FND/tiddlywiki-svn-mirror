<div tiddler="Customers" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200609291059" created="200609271149" tags="">People who just want a customised version of TiddlyWiki are well served by the existing OpenSource community. Osmosoft specialises in customers with special needs that can only be addressed through partnership on joint development work via a consultancy engagement.\n\nOur customers find that they get the most value when they share the results of our work on the same open source basis as TiddlyWiki itself. For example, RicohInnovations has supported work on the core code of TiddlyWiki.\n\nWith other partners we've been working specifically on versions of TiddlyWiki that meet special needs, such as adding &quot;unpluggability&quot; to some leading corporate web-based  systems.</div>

So I threw together a Frappr group(http://www.frappr.com/tiddlywiki). Its a Google Maps implementation that lets you put in a pin and say, 'I'm from over here' \n\nIf you use TW feel free to go to the map and add yourself.\n&lt;&lt;&lt;\nAs of now there's a few dozen people listed, with a strong showing in the US, western Europe and the Far East. It'd be good to see some South American, African or Antarctican people showing up too.</div>

<div tiddler="24 February 2006" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200602241609" created="200602031922" tags="news">There's an interesting article over at [[CodingHorror notes|http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000523.html]] that makes the point that sometimes the best icons are actually words. I rather like the idea, and of course TiddlyWiki makes use of it extensively. I think it's solid, though: my understanding is that we recognise words by their overall shape - particularly the pattern of ascenders and descenders - and we do so at a glance, without having to scan each letter individually. Which are precisely the characteristics that icon designers strive for.\n\nOtherwise, there's fewer links than usual here because I'm starting to use [[my del.icio.us account|http://del.icio.us/jeremyruston]] to post stuff</div>

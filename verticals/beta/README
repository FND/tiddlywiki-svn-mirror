TiddlyWiki beta

This directory contains what is required to build a beta version of TiddlyWiki.
There are two recipes:
    index.2.6.2.B5.html.recipe
    empty.2.6.2.B5.html.recipe
(This document assumes the release is version 2.6.2 beta 5.)

These recipes are used to build the content of tiddlywiki.com/beta and an empty
TiddlyWiki document.
The script "bldbeta" can be used to cook these recipes.

In preparation for a release, the following steps need to be taken:
* set version number in Trunk/core/js/Version.js
* update build and upload scripts to use the respective version number
* update beta vertical's recipes
* update beta vertical's NewFeatures tiddler (including modified date)
* tag release to Tags/core/:
  svn copy http://svn.tiddlywiki.org/Trunk/core http://svn.tiddlywiki.org/Tags/core/REL-2.6.2_Beta5

After building, the "index" document needs to be saved in the browser once to
set the title and generate the RSS feed.
This step can be automated:
    config.options.chkGenerateAnRssFeed = true; saveChanges();
(e.g. executed via Firebug's JavaScript console)
NB: This circumvents propagateOption, thus preventing a SystemSettings tiddler
from being created - which is generally desirable.

For 2.6.2 beta 5 these need to be cooked and the resultant TiddlyWikis copied
onto the server as follows:
    index.2.6.2.B5.html => http://www.tiddlywiki.com/beta/index.html
    empty.2.6.2.B5.html => http://www.tiddlywiki.com/beta/empty.html
    empty.2.6.2.B5.html => http://www.tiddlywiki.com/upgrade/index.html
    compressed.2.6.2.B5.html => http://www.tiddlywiki.com/beta/compressed.html
The script "uploadbeta" can be used to upload the index and empty documents onto
the tiddlywiki.com server (you will be prompted for username and password twice).

Immediately after a release, the beta version number should be incremented.

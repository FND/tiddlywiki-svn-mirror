<div tiddler="HelloThere" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200702280806" created="200511221854" tags="welcome" anon="undefined" changecount="11">Welcome to version &lt;&lt;version&gt;&gt; of TiddlyWiki. Feedback and discussion is welcome in the [[TiddlyWikiDev Google group|http://groups.google.com/group/TiddlyWikiDev]].\n\n@@Note - this is unstable, potentially broken ''beta'' code: it's not quite finished and it's not been tested with the various [[Plugins]] on which TiddlyWiki users rely. Don't use it for anything important unless you know what you're doing.@@\n\nThis is beta 4 of 2.2 that includes various bug fixes over the previous beta 3. It also features a new, simplified animation for opening tiddlers that should perform better across a range of browsers. Finally, there is some documentation about the new ServerAdaptorMechanism.\n\nThis substantial new release of TiddlyWiki adds several features:\n* A new 'backstage' user interface to group together operations that are needed by authors rather than readers or users\n** The backstage area by default only appears for non-read-only TiddlyWikis; DownloadSoftware and open this TW from a file:// URL to try it out\n* The beginnings of a new framework to support synchronising tiddlers with external servers and files\n** See [[Socialtext Unplugged|http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2006/12/socialtext_unpl.html]] for an example; more to come soon\n* Ability to use &lt;PRE&gt; tags in the store area to avoid having to escape newlines and backslashes\n* Added paramifier for overriding current read-only state (eg, http://www.tiddlywiki.com/beta/#readOnly:no)\n* Embolden tags in the tag listing that are also defined as tiddlers\n* Improved {{{&lt;&lt;newTiddler&gt;&gt;}}} and {{{&lt;&lt;newJournal&gt;&gt;}}} macros to accept custom fields\n* Rearranged shadow tiddlers into their own, unencoded store area\n* Improved support for XMLHttpRequest operations\n* Various improved error messages\n* Greatly improved startup speed, and improved performance for many other common operations\n* Extensive bug fixes and refactorings\n* ...and by popular request, we've started to reformat the TiddlyWiki source code to use the more conventional K&amp;R layout standard\nSee the full [[release note at tiddlywiki.org|http://trac.tiddlywiki.org/tiddlywiki/wiki/ReleaseNoteTwoPointTwo]]</div>

<pre>Welcome to version &lt;&lt;version&gt;&gt; of TiddlyWiki, a reusable non-linear personal web notebook (see the [[main site|http://www.tiddlywiki.com/]] for more details).

@@This is beta code -- please test it and use it as much as you can, but be cautious about trusting it with important data@@

There shouldn't be any more major changes before the final release in the next few days, so this makes a good opportunity to test your plugins against the new core code. If you have any feedback or questions, please join the discussion in the [[TiddlyWikiDev Google group|http://groups.google.com/group/TiddlyWikiDev]].</pre>

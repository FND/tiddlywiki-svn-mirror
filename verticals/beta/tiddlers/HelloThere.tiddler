<pre>Welcome to version &lt;&lt;version&gt;&gt; of TiddlyWiki. Feedback and discussion is welcome in the [[TiddlyWikiDev Google group|http://groups.google.com/group/TiddlyWikiDev]].

@@Note - this is unstable, potentially broken ''beta'' code: it's not quite finished and it's not been tested with the various [[Plugins]] on which TiddlyWiki users rely. Don't use it for anything important unless you know what you're doing.@@

This is beta 4 of 2.2 that includes various bug fixes over the previous beta 3. It also features a new, simplified animation for opening tiddlers that should perform better across a range of browsers. Finally, there is some documentation about the new ServerAdaptorMechanism.

<pre>Tiddlers tagged {{{systemServer}}} wrap up all the connection details of a particular server so that they can be accessed quickly.

A list of available {{{systemServer}}} tiddlers is presented at the start of the ImportTiddlers macro. Selecting one of them pre-selects the relevant fields in the wizard. After a successful import operation, ImportTiddlers also offers the opportunity to automatically create a {{{systemServer}}} tiddler with the details of the server that was used. {{{systemServer}}} tiddlers are also used by the [[syncing]] command.

Here's an example {{{systemServer}}} tiddler:

&lt;&lt;&lt;
|''Description:''|My example server|
|''Type:''|mediawiki|
|''URL:''|http://www.myexampleserver.org/x/|
|''Workspace:''|Main|
|''~TiddlerFilter:''|[tags[important unpluggable]]|
&lt;&lt;&lt;

The fields are as follows:

|!Field |!Description |!Status |
|Description |Brief description of the server |Optional |
|Type |Type of server connection eg {{{file}}} or {{{mediawiki}}} |Optional - defaults to {{{file}}} |
|URL |Host URL of the server |Mandatory |
|Workspace |Name of the workspace |Optional |
|TiddlerFilter |Specifies which tiddlers are to be imported |Optional |</pre>
</div>

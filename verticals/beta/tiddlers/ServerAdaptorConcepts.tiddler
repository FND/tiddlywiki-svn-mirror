As standard, TiddlyWiki provides the FileAdaptor for talking to static TiddlyWiki files but others are available for talking to popular wiki servers\n* A //host// string identifies a particular server, usually by it's URL\n* A //workspace// string identifies a particular compartment or storage area within a server, for instance the name of a wiki on a shared MediaWiki server\n* A //title// identifies a tiddler within a particular workspace\nVia the ServerAdaptorExtendedFields, particular tiddlers can have a connection to a particular server.</div>

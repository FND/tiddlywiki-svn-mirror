''by ignoring'' — or postponing consideration of — the possibility that ''the larger context'' may influence the smaller... Our hypothesis runs counter to this... The [[observer must be included|responsibility]] within the focus of observation, and what can be studied is always a ''relationship'' or an infinite regress of relationships. Never a “thing”.\n!!!!--Gregory Bateson, //Steps to an Ecology of Mind//, 1972</div>

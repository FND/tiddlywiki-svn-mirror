I have created a device that turns acronyms that are used on the phone or in e-mail into what they mean. This would be great if deployed across BT as we would be able to understand what people are saying.

In e-mails when an acronym is transformed it is highlighted in yellow and on the phone the acronym meanings are read out by Patrick Stewart.

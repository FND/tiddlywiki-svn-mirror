BT has supported several projects and initiatives with cash, code or both.

|[img[UnaMesa logo|image/unamesa_logo.png][http://www.unamesa.org]]|When BT acquired [[Osmosoft]] in 2007, Osmosoft's right to the TiddlyWiki code base was transferred to ~UnaMesa, a not-for-profit foundation based in California, USA. BT continues to support ~UnaMesa through cash sponsorship and partial payment of ~UnaMesa staff salaries.|
|[img[TiddlyWiki logo|image/twlrg_logo.png][http://www.tiddlywiki.com]]|TiddlyWiki sits at the heart of BT's open source innovation team, [[Osmosoft]], who have produced several plugins and products for public use under a BSD licence. In addition, BT has paid for several members of the ~TiddlyWiki community to meet in London to improve the organisation of the product team. The founder of the project, Jeremy Ruston, is the Head of Open Source Innovation for BT, and is the manager of Osmosoft.|

|[img[Open Health Tools logo|image/oht_logo.png][http://www.openhealthtools.org/]]|Through involvement with NHS projects and our health IT integration experience, BT understands the value of open, interoperable health information standards. Open Health Tools is an initiative to define, refine and implement health interoperability standards within an open source collaborative framework. The project enjoys the benefit of cutting edge developments in other IT sectors through its roots in the Eclipse Foundation, and through the involvement of companies like BT, to form a critical mass of experience, knowledge and adoption.

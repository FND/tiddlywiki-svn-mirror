<pre>BT uses several open source products both for internal and external initiatives and products. 

We would like to place on record our thanks and appreciation to all the people who worked on the following open source projects.

{{{Note the list of products and projects and all associated text should be written by someone else - this is just holding copy for purposes of discussion. But FOSSology, FOSSBazaar, OSS Census, Nagios Network monitoring could all appear here}}}

 BT uses various flavours of Linux throughout the organisation, not only as a file server or database manager, but also within our [[HomeHub|http://www.homehub.bt.com/]] product. The amendments made to the code were returned to the core.

 TiddlyWiki is used within BT not only as a desktop version but also as a server-side adaptation. It also sits at the heart of BT's open source innovation team, [[Osmosoft]]. Osmosoft has also helped to develop an open source server-side implementation of TiddlyWiki, known as ccTiddly. You can find out more about this product on the [[TiddlyWiki.org website|http://tiddlywiki.org/wiki/CcTiddly]].

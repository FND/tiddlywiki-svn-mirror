<pre>BT does not have a specific policy with regards to the licensing of ''new'' open source projects, but rather recognises that the choice of licence depends on the project under consideration.

However, BT broadly discourages the proliferation of additional open source licences and believes that the existing selection of licences should be sufficient for any purpose.

BT's open source innovation department, [[Osmosoft]], takes a slightly different approach. Their policy can be seen [[here|http://osmosoft.com/#Licensing]].</pre>

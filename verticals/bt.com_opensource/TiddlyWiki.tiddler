<pre>~TiddlyWiki is a wiki packaged within a single html file, complete with all the content, the editing and saving functionality, search and tagging capabilities and much more. It can run locally from your hard drive (so it's great for taking notes or organising personal information) or it can sit on a server. It's very extensible; there are over 400 plugins developed by the [[TiddlyWiki community|http://groups.google.co.uk/group/TiddlyWiki]].

You can find out more about TiddlyWiki at the official website: [[http://www.tiddlywiki.com|http://www.tiddlywiki.com]].</pre>

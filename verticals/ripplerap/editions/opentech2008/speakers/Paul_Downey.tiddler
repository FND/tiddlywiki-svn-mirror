<pre><html>Adam Green currently serves as civic communications director for MoveOn.org Civic Action, where he leads MoveOn’s ongoing campaign for Net Neutrality and related Internet freedom issues. He worked with Stanford Law School professor Larry Lessig to assemble a bipartisan alliance urging both major political parties to protect online political speech by putting video of presidential debates into the public domain. He also led MoveOn’s recent campaign—with bloggers and film director Robert Greenwald—against Fox hosting a Democratic presidential campaign. Previously, he served as the Democratic National Committee’s press secretary in Oregon during the 2004 presidential campaign, communications director for the New Jersey Democratic Party from 2003 to 2004, and press secretary for South Dakota Democratic Sen. Tim Johnson’s successful re-election in 2002. A native of New Jersey, he studied political communications and economics at The George Washington University in Washington, D.C., and attended law school at the University of Virginia.</html></pre>

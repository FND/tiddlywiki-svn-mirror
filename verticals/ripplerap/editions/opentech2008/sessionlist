    <title>Reinventing political media (the rise of semi-pro journalism?)</title>
    <link>http://confabb.com/conferences/60420-personal-democracy-forum-2008/sessions/16806/details</link>
    <description>You don't need a license to practice journalism, and more and more non-professionals are making news. In the process, gatekeepers are disappearing and a much more vibrant and messy public discourse is emerging. What does all this mean for political media? This panel of expert practitioners will cover everything from the rise of "citizen journalism" and "pro-am" collaboration, to how this changes the nature of journalism itself, to the shifting role of the pundit, to whether all this new media participation is also affecting the political narrative.

In recent years, we're seeing more self-organizing "money-bombs," be they the ones Ron Paul's supporters made famous, or the ones that bloggers are generating around candidates and causes. How does a money-bomb come together? What are the successful ingredients for one? Moderated by Julie Barko Germany.</description>

    <title>Profiles in Anti-Competition</title>
    <link>http://confabb.com/conferences/60420-personal-democracy-forum-2008/sessions/16833/details</link>
    <description>What allowed a guy named Craig who had a list to transform it into one of the biggest sites on the Internet? What allowed 2 guys with a garage as a work space to build one of the top search engines in the world? What allowed a husband and wife with a political opinion and a one-page website to build a 3.2 million person activist organization?

The ability to compete on a level playing field. As the Internet moves society away from a top-down culture and toward a bottom-up culture, key to this new culture's success is the ability of new ideas to easily bubble up and compete against older ideas. But we've seen numerous examples of "the next big thing" being held back by incumbents who are serving as gatekeepers and blocking competition. This panel will shine the spotlight on some of these examples, and offer some insights into how fair competition can work to the benefit of all.

    <description>Somewhere between expensive and highly-produced commercial video and the millions of home-made videos people post of their babies lies an enormous opportunity for online political video. Short-form and hard-hitting political mashups are now a steady part of many media diets, influencing the political conversation in powerful new ways. At this session, our experts will talk about how they conceive of online video projects, how to understand the ecology of viewer attention, and how they know when they're having an impact.

    <description>Why is it that the best designed government web portals are for collecting your taxes, and the worst ones are for gathering your input? Maybe it's time for Government 2.0. This panel of experts are are pioneers of e-democracy, and they will wrestle with these questions:
-How can we help elected officials listen and interact more effectively with their constituents?
-Can government be reinvented as a platform for civic collaboration?
-What lessons have you learned from your own e-democracy projects?
-What obstacles stand in the way of progress?

    <description>While national political blogs get all the attention, local bloggers are actually where the action is. All over the country, local blogs are shaking up the local scene, covering neglected political stories, exposing scandals, and fostering a new kind of community. This panel of expert practitioners will discuss how local political blogs are big fish in small fishbowls, and tackle questions like:
-What is the nature of the opportunity for local political bloggers, in terms of serving their community or affecting the political debate?
-If you build it, do they come? How do you get participation?
-Why are some local political blogs having an impact, and others not so much?
-How do you sustain this kind of work? Does it have to be a labor of love?

    <description>The world of ideas and policy-mongering is changing when everyone, in effect, owns their own printing press and the power of old media gatekeepers is diminished, if not completely gone. And yet, thought-leaders like the Heritage Foundation and the New Politics Institute (an arm of the New Democratic Network) are still relevant and influential. If your job is to move ideas and policy into positions of influence and implementation, you want to come to this panel to hear how it's being done. Moderated by Allison Fine</description>

    <title>Ideas that Spread Win: Going Viral Online</title>
    <link>http://confabb.com/conferences/60420-personal-democracy-forum-2008/sessions/16825/details</link>
    <description>We may be drenched in information and bombarded by messages, but there's no question that ideas that spread themselves tend to win. Our panel of experts will tackle these questions:
-What was your biggest viral success? Why did it spread?
-What was your biggest flop? Why?
-Is there a science to designing sites or messages that make them more likely to spread? Or is this an art?
-What tools do you use for moving your ideas?

    <title>The Cross-Partisan Movement for Political Transparency and Watchdogging Government from Below</title>
    <link>http://confabb.com/conferences/60420-personal-democracy-forum-2008/sessions/16826/details</link>
    <description>In the past few years, a strange bedfellow coalition of political bloggers from left to right, along with good government groups, have forged new alliances to open government to greater transparency. Our panel of experts will explore:
-Why is the movement for greater political transparency flourishing now?
-Do left and right agree on core principles, or is this a marriage of convenience?
-What are best practices in watchdogging government from below?
-What are the government's obligations in improving political transparency?

    <description>More people are spending more time going online to find out political information, and yet online political advertising lags behind traditional media. Where should you be spending your paid media dollars? And, if you're a political content creator, where are the opportunities for making money online? Our panel of experts will address these questions, and explore:
-Does advertising on blogs work?
-Can bloggers make a living from their sites?
-Is the market for political advertising online growing? Where are the opportunities in that market?
-Are political campaigns and advocacy groups spending their money wisely online?

    <url>http://joetrippi.com/</url>
    <bio>Joe Trippi, heralded on the cover of The New Republic as the man who “reinvented campaigning,” was born in California and began his political career working on Edward M. Kennedy’s presidential campaign in 1980. His work in presidential politics continued with the campaigns of Walter Mondale, Gary Hart, Richard Gephardt and most recently Howard Dean.

As a campaign manager, Trippi has run presidential, Senate, gubernatorial and mayoral campaigns. He was selected by former Vice President Walter Mondale to manage Iowa’s first-in-the-nation caucuses in 1984 and later went on to run several key states for the Mondale for President campaign. In 1988, Trippi was the Deputy National Campaign Manager for Richard Gephardt’s presidential campaign.

In 2004, he was National Campaign Manager for Howard Dean’s presidential campaign, pioneering the use of online technology to organize what became the largest grassroots movement in presidential politics. Through Trippi’s innovative use of the internet for small-donor fundraising, Dean for America ended up raising more money than any Democratic presidential campaign in history, all with donations averaging less than $100 each. Trippi’s innovations have brought fundamental change to the electoral system and will be the model for how all future political campaigns are run.

Trippi began his work in media consulting at the Democratic media firm of Doak, Shrum and Associates, where he was involved in developing the strategy and producing the media for the successful campaigns of Jerry Baliles for Governor of Virginia and Bob Casey for Governor of Pennsylvania. Trippi was also instrumental in the re-election campaigns of U.S. Senator Alan Cranston of California and Mayor Tom Bradley of Los Angeles.

Joe Trippi has been profiled in GQ, Wired, Fast Company, The New Republic and The New York Times Magazine. He is an MSNBC political analyst and former Harvard University fellow. He currently heads the Washington, DC political consultancy, Trippi &amp; Associates.

In addition to his work in politics, Trippi works with a number of high-tech companies including Wave Systems, Progeny Linux Systems, and Smart Paper Networks.

Trippi is the author of, “The Revolution Will Not Be Televised: Democracy, the Internet and the Overthrow of Everything,” the story of how his revolutionary use of the Internet and an impassioned, contagious desire to overthrow politics as usual grew into a national grassroots movement and changed the face of politics, and indeed many aspects of American life, forever.

The father of three, he lives with his wife, Kathleen Lash, and their terrier, Kasey, on the eastern shore of Maryland.</bio>

<pre>A company called [[Osmosoft|http://www.osmosoft.com]] created RippleRap. Osmosoft is a small open source innovation company bought by [[BT|http://www.bt.com]] in May 2007 to support BT in understanding and adopting open source solutions in a sensible, responsible fashion. BT decided that the best way to go about doing this was to hire people who already had experience of running a successful open source project, and they therefore hired Jeremy Ruston (through the acquisition of his company, Osmosoft) because of his experience creating and running the open source TiddlyWiki project.</pre></div>

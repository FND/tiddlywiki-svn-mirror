<pre>RippleRap is built on [[TiddlyWiki|http://www.tiddlywiki.com/]], an open source wiki platform that enables a high degree of customisation. Learning to customise TiddlyWiki is surprisingly easy - there are resources at http://www.tiddlywiki.org/, and a pair of lively discussion groups at http://groups.google.com/TiddlyWiki and http://groups.google.com/TiddlyWiki.

Alternatively, you can talk to [[BT]] who offer a range of ProfessionalServices around RippleRap.</pre>

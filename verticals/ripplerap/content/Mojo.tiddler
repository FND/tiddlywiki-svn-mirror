<pre>Mojo is a Web friendly ([[REST|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer]]) exposure of [[BT's Web21C SDK|http://web21c.bt.com]]. You can use this to initiate telephone calls and send SMS messages from Widgets, Gadgets, Web mashups, etc! Sign up for an account at [[http://mojo.bt.com|http://mojo.bt.com]], or come over to the stall for a demo in person.

We've created a simple click-to-call functionality into [[RippleRap|Bonjour!!]] using the [[Mojo API|http://mojo.bt.com/howtos]], so you can see it in action. Enter your phone number in the box below, click 'enter' and, if it's not engaged, the [[Bat Phone|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat_phone]] on our stall at Le Web will ring. When we pick up the phone, the call will then be connected with your phone by the ~Web21C SDK. (BT will not charge you for this incoming call, but your mobile phone operator might, especially if you are roaming).

|Your mobile number in this format: +44 798...|<<option txtMojoTelno>>|

Obviously we may be busy serving customers at the time, so if it doesn't work please try later, or if you'd like to see the demo in person swing by our stall.

If you're a developer, then you'll be interested in seeing the code. One of the great aspects of TiddlyWiki is that the entire file - including content, the code which uses the SDK, and the code required for TiddlyWiki to function - can all be inspected. Have a play around and see what you think!</pre>

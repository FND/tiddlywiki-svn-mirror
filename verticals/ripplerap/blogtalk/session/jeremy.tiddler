<pre><<Speaker>> TiddlyWiki is a technical marvel, and since bursting onto the scene three years ago it has made quite an impression. It is unlike any other wiki, mainly because it can be used in so many different ways - many of which do not even look like a wiki. And it now forms the cornerstone of [[BT|http://www.bt.com]]'s open source innovation lab.
Jeremy Ruston, the original creator of TiddlyWiki (and the head of open source innovation for BT), will give a quick demo of the product for those who were not at BlogTalk last time, before showcasing some of the unique features being exploited in the latest products from the TiddlyWiki community.

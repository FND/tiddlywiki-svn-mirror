<div title="Share notes" modifier="PhilHawksworth" created="200711051056">
<pre>If you're connected to the web, you can share your notes with others and receive theirs in return, all saved to your local ~RippleRap file, and all fully searchable!

To share your notes, just [[provide a username and password|AccountDetails]], and then check the Share Notes checkbox. Your username and password will ensure that your notes are attributed to you in other people's version of ~RippleRap.

Once you've enabled sharing, other people's notes will gradually appear under the items in the agenda on the left.

You can find out more about how ~RippleRap works in the FAQs</pre>

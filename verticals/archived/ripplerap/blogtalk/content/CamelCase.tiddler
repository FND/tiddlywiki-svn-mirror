<div title="CamelCase" modifier="PhilWhitehouse" created="200711051317">
<pre>CamelCase describes a word containing an upper case letter. The first word in this paragraph is written in camel case. If you write a word in camel case in a TiddlyWiki, it creates a link. Click on the link, and you'll find an empty tiddler ready to populate with content. It's a quick way of writing linked content. The other way of creating links is by using [[Double square brackets]].</pre>

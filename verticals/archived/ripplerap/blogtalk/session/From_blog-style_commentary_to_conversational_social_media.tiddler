<pre><html>Blogging has mainly been used for commentary on a particular topic, for publishing news items of interest, and for personal thoughts and ideas.  However, many new social media services - text and video microblogging (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://www.seesmic.com/">Seesmic</a>), social network whiteboards or walls, and so on - are focusing on conversations via social networks, with replies often having equal status to the original messages.  The nature of these new services is also somewhat different from blogging, focussing on spontaneous (shorter) messages and more random chat topics.  We will discuss what distinguishes blogging from other social media discussion systems, and see if blogging habits are changing in the face of these new social media services (e.g., see <a href="http://wordpress.com/blog/2008/01/28/introducing-prologue/">Prologue</a>).</html></pre>

<pre><<Speaker>> Consumer Insights are the most important factors associated with effective product development in the packaged goods industry today. Qualitative research methods are well suited to understand the consumer, most importantly needs, dreams, desires and the feelings and provides the inspiration to drive marketers to develop relevant products. This paper explains a new approach to qualitative online research, where consumers and clients come together in a co-creation process online.

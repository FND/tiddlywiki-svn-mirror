<pre><<Speaker>> Social networking has become one of the most important types of Internet service. However, today's social networks suffer from a lack of openness and portability. Users are becoming bored with having to be involved in too many similar but separate networks. In this presentation, we discuss a decentralised architecture that can turn a user's blog into a social network based on open standards. With this approach, users will be able to create, store, and manage their profile and social graph on their own site, as well as being able to share data among different sites. A prototype is being developed as a proof of concept and also to test the acceptance and the usability of this approach.

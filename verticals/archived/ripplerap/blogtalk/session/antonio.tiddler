<pre><<Speaker>> Nowadays, we are experiencing the commoditisation of social networking platforms. There are trends towards integrating both content- and contact-oriented platforms. However, social networks remain as data silos in relation to each other. This contribution proposes an architecture for distributed social networking. Based on the notion of distributed user-centric identity, our proposal extends this by attaching profile information. It also bridges the gap between distributed identity and distributed publishing capabilities.

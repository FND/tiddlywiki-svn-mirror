<div tiddler="HowToUseThis" modifier="BraddeGraf" modified="200606282102" created="200606281910" tags="how-to">This is a ''template for writing a hyperlinked whitepaper or other similar document''. It is a TiddlyWiki, which allows you to create and edit your document interactively in a browser from a file on your local harddrive. \n\nWhen local, it is editable by you; when published to the web, it's read-only. The former is called AuthorMode, and it includes all the links and tools you need to work efficiently. \n\nYou publish it by putting it on a website, where it automatically converts to PublishMode, showing only the content, and hiding the authoring tools.\n\nTo use it, you:\n# SaveYourOwnCopy, which creates an editable version on your harddrive\n# Open that saved file in a browser\n# Make it your own\n\nTo make it your own, you need to do 1 and 2 above first. Do it now, then :\n# ''Basic editing'' is outside the scope here, but just double click on the title of any &quot;tiddler&quot; to edit it. See [[TiddlyWiki Tutorial|http://www.blogjones.com/TiddlyWikiTutorial.html]] for help, and [[TiddlyWiki Markup]] for syntax.\n# Click on ''Options'' on the right and ''change the username'' to yours. You should use a WikiWord, e.g. JohnSmith\n# ''Change the SiteTitle and SiteSubtitle'' to whatever you want them to be.\n# ''Edit DefaultTiddlers'' to specifiy which tiddlers you want open when the file is loaded. This one has this section (HowToUseThis) which you will want to remove, and [[Purpose]], as a sample opening section.\n# Edit the WebMainMenu to ''create the section outline menu'' you want. \n# click on ''&lt;&lt;saveChanges&gt;&gt;'', then reload the page. This is necessary whenever you change the menu on the left.\n# ''Change the look'' by selecting an alternative stylesheet &lt;&lt;selectStylesheet&gt;&gt;, or on the right. To make your own, click on the &lt;&lt;tag stylesheets&gt;&gt; tag, pick on that is closest to what you want, copy the contents to a new tiddler tagged &quot;stylesheets&quot;, and edit away. You'll need to be be pretty good at CSS.\n# ''&lt;&lt;saveChanges&gt;&gt;'' often to protect your work, or check the AutoSave option under Options on the right, which will save it every time you finish editing any tiddler.</div>

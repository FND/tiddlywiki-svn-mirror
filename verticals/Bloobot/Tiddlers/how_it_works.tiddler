<div tiddler="how it works" modifier="YourName" modified="200605152250" created="200605102140" tags="">Bloobot works by using [[&quot;affiliate&quot; programs|http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;defl=en&amp;q=define:Affiliate+programs&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=glossary_definition&amp;ct=title]] at all the [[major online retailers|supported merchant sites]].\n\nWhenever you surf to a merchant it knows about, a little Bloobot logo [img[http://www.mediaventure.org/bloobot/images/bloobot2-tiny.jpg]] appears in the upper left, [[looking like this|Bloobot closed]]. That lets you know it's working, and clicking on it [[opens it up|Bloobot open]] to let you change your beneficiary, get info on the merchant and product, etc.\n\nWhen you choose a beneficiary, that determines the appropriate affiliate codes to use, depending on what retailer you're using. \n\nBloobot automatically appends the code where it's needed so that any purchases you make get credited to your chosen beneficiary.\n\nEach retailer tracks all such purchases and gives the owner of the code a 4-10% (depending on the retailer) commission on each one, distributed quarterly.\n</div>

Just free money for good things.\n\n''If you're not using it, you're throwing away money''.

BlooBot is here to make that easy.\n\nIt is a simple addition to your browser (Firefox only currently), that recognizes webpages of merchants we have agreements with, and &quot;handshakes&quot; with them in the background so that any purchases you make will generate commissions for your chosen beneficiary. \n\nSo what are you waiting for?

<div title="Do you plan to do something similar at future conferences?" modifier="PhilWhitehouse" created="200711291502" changecount="1">
<pre>Our intention is to use ~RippleRap as a vehicle for meeting the above goals; if it is successful at Le Web we may do something similar at other conferences we attend. Hopefully we'll get some useful feedback and possibly code contributions that improve the product. The code and process are all open source anyway; anyone can take the product and improve it, and use it at future conferences if they wish.</pre>

<div title="How does RippleRap work?" modifier="PhilWhitehouse" created="200711291502" changecount="1">
<pre>*The product at the heart of ~RippleRap is ~TiddlyWiki. This product includes all the functionality required to create, edit and save notes locally. ~TiddlyWiki can run on a server, but ~RippleRap isn't intended to be used in this way at Le Web.
*The sharing of notes with other delegates is done via RSS. When you've authorised sharing, ~TiddlyWiki creates an RSS feed that sends your notes to our server. The notes are combined with everyone else's notes on the server, and the aggregated notes are re-published as an RSS feed for your local copy of ~RippleRap. Once they're downloaded, they're stored locally and can be searched within your copy of ~RippleRap.
*The 'click to call' functionality is provided by [[BT's 21C SDK|http://sdk.bt.com]]. As it happens, ~TiddlyWiki is a great platform for building custom applications for this SDK. </pre>

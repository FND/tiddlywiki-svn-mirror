<div title="Why are you doing this?" modifier="PhilWhitehouse" created="200711291502" changecount="1">
<pre>BT recognises the importance of being a good citizen in the open source arena, and wants to play their part in sustaining and growing the ~TiddlyWiki community as a whole. The more people who take an interest in ~TiddlyWiki, the better it is for everyone involved, which is why the product is being showcased by BT at Le Web.

We'd also like to use ~RippleRap to demonstrate the services being provided by the BT 21C SDK. It so happens that ~TiddlyWiki is a great platform for building custom applications for this SDK. 

All the rights to the ~TiddlyWiki code have been passed to a non-for-profit foundation called [[UnaMesa|http://www.uamesa.org]], these rights are not owned by BT.</pre>

<div title="What's the relationship between BT and Osmosoft?" modifier="PhilWhitehouse" created="200711291501" changecount="1">
<pre>Osmosoft was bought by BT in May 2007, and our remit is to support BT in understanding and adopting open source solutions in a sensible, responsible fashion. BT decided that the best way to go about doing this was to hire people who already had experience of running a successful open source project, and they therefore hired Jeremy Ruston (through the acquisition of his company, Osmosoft) because of his experience creating and running the open source ~TiddlyWiki project.</pre>

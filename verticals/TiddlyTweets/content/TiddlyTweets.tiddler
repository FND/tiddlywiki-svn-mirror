<pre>You might be wondering what this is all about.

TiddlyTweets is the work of [[Fred|http://osmosoft.com/#%5B%5BFrederik%20Dohr%5D%5D]] and [[Jonathan|http://osmosoft.com/#%5B%5BJon%20Lister%5D%5D]] from [[Osmosoft|http://osmosoft.com]]. It serves as an example of a client-side mashup, creating a useful application in a web-friendly way, using only HTML, CSS and ~JavaScript.

<div tiddler="RefreshMechanism" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200511120139" created="200511120139" tags="mechanism">The objective is to be able to automatically update the display in response to changes in the tiddler store. It is used by the TemplateMechanism.\n\nThe approach is to register refreshDisplay() as a global notification handler in config.notifyTiddlers. (A global notification handler is registered with a 'name' of null, and is called whenever a tiddler changes, regardless of it's title).\n\nrefreshDisplay() uses refreshElements() iterates through the DOM looking for elements with a {{{refresh}}} attribute. It maps those values through an array of named handlers in config.refreshers  as follows:\n* refresh=&quot;link&quot; means that this element represents a link to a named tiddler. The name of the tiddler is taken from the {{{tiddlyLink}}} attribute of the link\n* refresh=&quot;content&quot; means that this element should be refreshed with the rendered contents of a tiddler named in the {{{tiddler}}} attribute. By default, TiddlyWiki will attempt to optimise things by only calling the refresh handler if the underlying tiddler text has changed. You can override this behaviour by specifying a value for the {{{force}}} attribute</div>

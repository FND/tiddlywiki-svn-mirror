<div tiddler="Contributing" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200602241819" created="200602071851" tags="community">I welcome contributions to the TiddlyWiki core: code, documentation, or anything else that helps to make it a better product.\n\nIn terms of code, I'm happy to accept small snippets inline in emails or group messages. For larger changes, I prefer to receive a modified version of the entire TiddlyWiki HTML file via email; I can then easily analyse the differences.\n\nTo maximise the chances of your work being accepted into the core, you should consider these points:\n* Is the code reasonably short?\n* Is the functionality nearly universally useful?\n* Is the functionality impractical to offer as a plugin?\n* Have you used the same coding conventions as the rest of the core?\n* Have you tested the change on all major browsers?\n</div>

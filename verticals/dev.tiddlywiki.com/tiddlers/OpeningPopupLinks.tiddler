<div tiddler="OpeningPopupLinks" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200512081609" created="200512081609" tags="bugs">The recent change to the PopupMechanism caused a bug whereby tiddlers selected from a popup menu (eg, 'references' on the toolbar) get opened at the top of the StoryColumn. The intended behaviour was that the tiddlers open immediately below the one containing the popup, but now I'm not so sure it wouldn't be better to show it //before// (which would give the appearance that it replaced the previous tiddler).</div>

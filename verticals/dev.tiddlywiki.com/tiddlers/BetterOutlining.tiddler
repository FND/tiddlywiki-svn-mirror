<div tiddler="BetterOutlining" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200512211820" created="200512211818" tags="featureIdeas">Several people have suggested adding real, interactive outlining:\n{{{\n*- This one is closed at the moment\n*+ This one is open\n** Meaning that you can see this one\n* This one will default to open\n}}}\nThe tree view is displayed as +/- buttons on the appropriate nodes. The desired behaviour is that the tiddler text is changed to reflect any expandy/collapsy actions (albeit perhaps flagged as a MinorChange). It will need the proposed BookmarkMechanism in order to work.</div>

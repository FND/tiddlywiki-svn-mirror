<div tiddler="21 December 2005" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200512211142" created="200512042059" tags="news">Although this beta is a big improvement over beta 5, we're still not quite there. Oustanding bugs and other issues are  tagged &lt;&lt;tag bugs&gt;&gt; while new feature ideas are tagged &lt;&lt;tag featureIdeas&gt;&gt;. I'm aiming for a final release before the end of the year.\n\nThis revision shows off a new ViewTemplate with a new SideLinking tags feature.  It shows tags that have been assigned to a tiddler in a column on the upper right. For tiddlers that are also used to tag other tiddlers, the incoming tags are shown in a column on the left (see, for example, [[mechanism]], [[systemTiddlers]], [[planning]]). It's influenced by the TagglyTagging variant of TiddlyWiki first developed by JodyFoo, and pluginised by SimonBaird over at [[MonkeyPirateTiddlyWiki|http://simonbaird.com/mptw/#%5B%5B5.%20Where%20did%20it%20come%20from%3F%5D%5D]].\n\nMost of the changes in the new version of TiddlyWiki are to implement the underlying TemplateMechanism, which allows plugin developers a much finer degree of control over the appearance and behaviour of TiddlyWikis. The new feature has meant adding or updating several of the internal [[mechanisms|mechanism]] of TiddlyWiki:\n* PageTemplateMechanism for controlling the layout of the entire TiddlyWiki page\n* TiddlerTemplateMechanism for controlling how individual tiddlers are displayed in view and edit mode\n* RefreshMechanism for automatically redrawing portions of the page affected by changes to tiddlers\n* WikifierMechanism for converting WikiSyntax text into HTML or text\nFurther features will build on these mechanisms to deliver dynamic theming of TiddlyWikis by orchestrating changes to templates and stylesheets. See TemplateOptions and try changing the default value for ViewTemplate to 'AlternativeViewTemplate'. (Changing the PageTemplate and StyleSheet in this way doesn't work yet).\n\nAs part of the template work, the tiddler toolbar is now based on [[macros]]. Several new [[macros]] have been introduced for use in toolbars and subtitles:\n* Support for tiddler creation dates\n* SimonBaird's CloseOthers macro\n* A new 'jump' macro intended to help navigation\n\nThe changes in this revision are quite deep, and will probably impact most existing macros. There shouldn't be any impact on existing [[Translations]], though.\n\n</div>

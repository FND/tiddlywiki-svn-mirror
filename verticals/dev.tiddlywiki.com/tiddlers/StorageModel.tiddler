<div tiddler="StorageModel" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200508181428" created="200508181428" tags="history internals">Earlier versions of TiddlyWiki used a series of hidden DIV tags to store tiddlers (the StorageFormat can be seen by inspecting view/source in your browser). This mechanism was used both for the initial delivery of the content and for transient, working storage. This meant that operations like 'search' involved extensive HTML DOM manipulations to access the content.\n\nRecent versions of TiddlyWiki still use DIV tags to deliver content to the browser, but immediately load the text of all tiddlers into a JavaScript data object model. This makes the content much easier to manipulate, and has enabled efficient implementation of the MissingTiddlers, OrphanTiddlers and ReferencesButton features.</div>

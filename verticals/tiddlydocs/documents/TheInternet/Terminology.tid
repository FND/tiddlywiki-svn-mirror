<html><p>The terms <i>Internet</i> and <i>World Wide Web</i> are often used in every-day speech without much distinction. However, the Internet and the <a title="World Wide Web" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">World Wide Web</a> are not one and the same. The Internet is a global data communications system. It is a hardware and software infrastructure that provides connectivity between <a class="mw-redirect" title="Computers" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computers">computers</a>. In contrast, the Web is one of the services communicated via the Internet. It is a collection of interconnected documents and other <a title="Resource (Web)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_%28Web%29">resources</a>, linked by <a title="Hyperlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink">hyperlinks</a> and <a title="Uniform Resource Locator" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator">URLs</a>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-0"><a title="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet#cite_note-0"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></p> <p>The term <i>the Internet</i>, when referring to <i>the</i> Internet, has traditionally been treated as a <a class="mw-redirect" title="Proper noun" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_noun">proper noun</a> and written with an initial <a title="Capital letter" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_letter">capital letter</a>. There is a trend to regard it as a generic term or common noun and thus write it as &quot;the internet&quot;, without the capital.</p></html>

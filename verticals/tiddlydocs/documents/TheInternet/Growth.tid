<html><p>Although the basic applications and guidelines that make the Internet possible had existed for almost two decades, the network did not gain a public face until the 1990s. On 6 August 1991, <a title="CERN" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN">CERN</a>, a pan European organisation for particle research, publicized the new <a title="World Wide Web" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">World Wide Web</a> project. The Web was invented by <a title="England" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England">English</a> scientist <a title="Tim Berners-Lee" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a> in 1989.</p> <p>An early popular <a title="Web browser" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">web browser</a> was <a title="ViolaWWW" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ViolaWWW">ViolaWWW</a>, patterned after <a title="HyperCard" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard">HyperCard</a> and built using the <a title="X Window System" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System">X Window System</a>. It was eventually replaced in popularity by the <a title="Mosaic (web browser)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_%28web_browser%29">Mosaic</a> web browser. In 1993, the <a title="National Center for Supercomputing Applications" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Center_for_Supercomputing_Applications">National Center for Supercomputing Applications</a> at the <a title="University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana-Champaign">University of Illinois</a> released version 1.0 of Mosaic, and by late 1994 there was growing public interest in the previously academic, technical Internet. By 1996 usage of the word <i>Internet</i> had become commonplace, and consequently, so had its use as a <a title="Synecdoche" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synecdoche">synecdoche</a> in reference to the World Wide Web.</p> <p>Meanwhile, over the course of the decade, the Internet successfully accommodated the majority of previously existing public computer networks (although some networks, such as <a title="FidoNet" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FidoNet">FidoNet</a>, have remained separate). During the 1990s, it was estimated that the Internet grew by 100% per year, with a brief period of explosive growth in 1996 and 1997.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-4"><a title="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> This growth is often attributed to the lack of central administration, which allows organic growth of the network, as well as the non-proprietary open nature of the Internet protocols, which encourages vendor interoperability and prevents any one company from exerting too much control over the network. <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-5"><a title="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></p> <p>Using various statistics, <a title="Advanced Micro Devices" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Micro_Devices">AMD</a> estimated the population of internet users to be 1.5 billion as of January 2009.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-6"><a title="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Internet_users_per_100_inhabitants_1997-2007_ITU.png/300px-Internet_users_per_100_inhabitants_1997-2007_ITU.png" alt="" /></p><p><img alt="" src="file:///Users/simonmcmanus/Library/Caches/TemporaryItems/moz-screenshot.jpg" /></p></html>

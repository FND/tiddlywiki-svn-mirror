<html><p>Many existing radio and television broadcasters provide Internet &quot;feeds&quot; of their live audio and video streams (for example, the <a title="BBC" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC#Internet">BBC</a>). They may also allow time-shift viewing or listening such as Preview, Classic Clips and Listen Again features. These providers have been joined by a range of pure Internet &quot;broadcasters&quot; who never had on-air licenses. This means that an Internet-connected device, such as a computer or something more specific, can be used to access on-line media in much the same way as was previously possible only with a <a title="Television" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television">television</a> or <a title="Radio" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio">radio</a> receiver. The range of material is much wider, from <a title="Pornography" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography">pornography</a> to highly specialized, technical <a title="Webcast" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webcast">webcasts</a>. <a title="Podcast" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast">Podcasting</a> is a variation on this theme, where&mdash;usually audio&mdash;material is downloaded and played back on a computer or shifted to a <a title="Portable media player" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_media_player">portable media player</a> to be listened to on the move. These techniques using simple equipment allow anybody, with little censorship or licensing control, to broadcast audio-visual material on a worldwide basis.</p> <p><a title="Webcam" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webcam">Webcams</a> can be seen as an even lower-budget extension of this phenomenon. While some webcams can give full-frame-rate video, the picture is usually either small or updates slowly. Internet users can watch animals around an African waterhole, ships in the <a title="Panama Canal" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_Canal">Panama Canal</a>, traffic at a local roundabout or monitor their own premises, live and in real time.

It uses a</p><a title="Adobe Flash" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash">flash</a><p>-based web player to stream and show video files. Registered users may upload an unlimited amount of video and build their own personal profile. YouTube claims that its users watch hundreds of millions, and upload hundreds of thousands, of videos daily</p></html>

<html><p>A <a title="Computer file" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file">computer file</a> can be <a class="mw-redirect" title="Electronic mail" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_mail">e-mailed</a> to customers, colleagues and friends as an <a title="E-mail attachment" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-mail_attachment">attachment</a>. It can be uploaded to a <a title="Website" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website">website</a> or <a title="File Transfer Protocol" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol">FTP</a> server for easy download by others. It can be put into a &quot;shared location&quot; or onto a <a title="File server" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_server">file server</a> for instant use by colleagues. The load of bulk downloads to many users can be eased by the use of &quot;<a title="Mirror (computing)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_%28computing%29">mirror</a>&quot; servers or <a title="Peer-to-peer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer">peer-to-peer</a> networks.</p> <p>In any of these cases, access to the file may be controlled by user <a title="Authentication" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication">authentication</a>, the transit of the file over the Internet may be obscured by <a title="Encryption" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption">encryption</a>, and money may change hands for access to the file. The price can be paid by the remote charging of funds from, for example, a credit card whose details are also passed&mdash;hopefully fully encrypted&mdash;across the Internet. The origin and authenticity of the file received may be checked by <a title="Digital signature" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature">digital signatures</a> or by <a title="MD5" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5">MD5</a> or other message digests.</p> <p>These simple features of the Internet, over a worldwide basis, are changing the production, sale, and distribution of anything that can be reduced to a computer file for transmission. This includes all manner of print publications, software products, news, music, film, video, photography, graphics and the other arts. This in turn has caused seismic shifts in each of the existing industries that previously controlled the production and distribution of these products.</p></html>

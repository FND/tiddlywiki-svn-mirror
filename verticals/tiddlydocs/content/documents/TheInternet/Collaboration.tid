<html><p>The low cost and nearly instantaneous sharing of ideas, knowledge, and skills has made <a title="Collaboration" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration">collaborative</a> work dramatically easier. Not only can a group cheaply communicate and share ideas, but the wide reach of the Internet allows such groups to easily form in the first place. An example of this is the <a title="Free software movement" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_movement">free software movement</a>, which has produced <a title="Linux" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a>, <a title="Mozilla Firefox" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Firefox">Mozilla Firefox</a>, <a title="OpenOffice.org" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenOffice.org">OpenOffice.org</a> etc.</p> <p>Internet &quot;chat&quot;, whether in the form of <a class="mw-redirect" title="IRC" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC">IRC</a> chat rooms or channels, or via <a title="Instant messaging" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_messaging">instant messaging</a> systems, allow colleagues to stay in touch in a very convenient way when working at their computers during the day. Messages can be exchanged even more quickly and conveniently than via e-mail. Extensions to these systems may allow files to be exchanged, &quot;whiteboard&quot; drawings to be shared or voice and video contact between team members.</p> <p><a class="mw-redirect" title="Version control" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control">Version control</a> systems allow collaborating teams to work on shared sets of documents without either accidentally overwriting each other's work or having members wait until they get &quot;sent&quot; documents to be able to make their contributions.</p> <p>Business and project teams can share calendars as well as documents and other information. Such collaboration occurs in a wide variety of areas including scientific research, software development, conference planning, political activism and creative writing.</p></html>

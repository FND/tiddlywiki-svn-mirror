<div tiddler="privacy" modifier="YourName" modified="200605161447" created="200605112357" tags="">We, like most people, value privacy and security highly. \n\nBloobot is structured so we don't need to know any personal data about you. You don't need to register, and we thus can't contact you except through the Bloobot button under your control.\n\nNor does Bloobot communicate anything about your behavior to us or anyone. Communication with our server is minimal and almost entirely from us to you. Anyone who wishes to can confirm that because the code is exposed and viewable at [[install Bloobot|http://www.mediaventure.org/bloobot/bloobotdev11.user.js]]. \n\nThere are two infrequent times that your Bloobot sends information to our server:\n# The first time you use it, it sends a notice to our server that a new user is activated, identified by a unique ID. This allows us to reliable count the number of users (as opposed to just those who view the script), and to [[credit you for helping promote Bloobot|credits for spreading the word]].\n# Each time you initiate a session with a merchant that Bloobot recognizes, it handshakes with our server to know what to do. \nThat's it. \n\n</div>

<div tiddler="install it" modifier="YourName" modified="200605161447" created="200605101617" tags="">BlooBot is easy to install, and requires no registration. It will get even easier in upcoming versions. \n\nIn its current prototype form, it runs only on Firefox 1.5 and up, and is built on Greasemonkey (also from [[Mozilla|http://mozilla.org]]), which needs to be installed first. Both it and BlooBot are easy to install and uninstall.\n\nFollow these simple instructions carefully and you'll have no problem. \n\n#First, assuming your on Firefox 1.5, ''[[install Greasemonkey|http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/]]''. It's fast and simple. \n#''If it seems like nothing happens'', it's probably because you have pop-ups blocked.  You'll need to allow them for the Greasemonkey installation, and re-click the &quot;install Greasemonkey&quot; link.\n#You then need to ''restart Firefox''.\n#Now ''[[install Bloobot|http://www.mediaventure.org/bloobot/bloobotdev11.user.js]]''. This should show up as Javascript code in your browser. Firefox should prompt you with an ''Install button in the upper right'', but if not, install it using its Tools menu, where there will be a new menu item to &quot;Install User Script&quot;. Accept the default configuration and install.\n\nThat's it. It should work on all the [[supported merchant sites]].\n\n*So, try it - Go to any Amazon product page, like ''[[this one|http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A3WS8O/sr=1-2/qid=1135549102/ref=pd_bbs_2/002-7197333-3186429?%5Fencoding=UTF8]]'' or browse around ''[[Barnes and Noble|http://www.barnesandnoble.com]]'' or ''[[Sony Style|http://www.sonystyle.com]]''. \n\nA little Bloobot logo [img[http://www.mediaventure.org/bloobot/images/bloobot2-tiny.jpg]] should show up in the upper left. Click on it to see the approximate commission the current product would yield (Amazon only right now). All product links on the page will link to a URL at www.mediaventure.org with the information needed to link back with the appropriate code, which you can see by mousing over such links. </div>

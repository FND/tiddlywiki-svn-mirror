TiddlyWiki beta

This directory contains what is required to build an alpha version of TiddlyWiki.
There is one recipe:
    empty.html.recipe

This recipe is used to build the content of tiddlywiki.com/alpha TiddlyWiki document.
The script "bldalpha" can be used to cook these recipes.

In preparation for a release, the following steps need to be taken:
* set version number in Trunk/core/js/Version.js
* tag release to Tags/core/:
  svn copy http://svn.tiddlywiki.org/Trunk/core http://svn.tiddlywiki.org/Tags/core/REL-2.x.y_Alpha2


After building, the empty TiddlyWiki needs to be copied onto the server as follows:

    empty.html => http://www.tiddlywiki.com/alpha/empty.html

The script "uploadalpha" can be used to upload the empty documents onto the tiddlywiki.com server (you will be prompted for username and password twice).

Immediately after a release, the alpha version number should be incremented.

TiddlyWiki beta

This directory contains what is required to build an alpha version of TiddlyWiki.
There is one recipe:
    empty.html.recipe

This recipe is used to build the content of tiddlywiki.com/alpha TiddlyWiki document.
The script "bldalpha" can be used to cook these recipes.

In preparation for a release, the following step needs to be taken:
* set version number in Trunk/core/js/Version.js

There is no need to tag the alpha release in subversion, since alpha releases are not needed to be reproducible.

After building, the empty TiddlyWiki needs to be copied onto the server as follows:

    empty.html => http://www.tiddlywiki.com/alpha/empty.html

The script "uploadalpha" can be used to upload the empty documents onto the tiddlywiki.com server (you will be prompted for username and password twice).

Immediately after a release, the alpha version number should be incremented.

<div tiddler="HideEditingFeatures" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200508181411" created="200508181411" tags="features options">This is an advanced option that lets you choose whether editting features are shown when a TiddlyWiki file is viewed over {{{http:}}} (as opposed to {{{file:}}}).\n\nTo publish a TiddlyWiki with the editting features hidden you'll need to create a tiddler tagged with 'systemConfig' and include in it the line:\n\n{{{\nconfig.options.chkHttpReadOnly = true;\n}}}\n\nEnd users can then override the setting using the AdvancedOptions panel.</div>

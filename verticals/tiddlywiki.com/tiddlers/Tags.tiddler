<pre>You can categorise a tiddler by assigning it special keywords called [[Tags]].

This site uses the convention that the names of [[Tags]] start with a lower case letter, and tiddlers with an upper case letter, but this is not actually enforced.

Tags can be tiddlers themselves, with their own tags, so you can have hierarchies of tiddlers.  This is a surprisingly useful and powerful technique has been dubbed TagglyTagging by the [[Community]].</pre>

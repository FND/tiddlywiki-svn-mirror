<div tiddler="UsingThisSite" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200507121723" created="200507121723" tags="features">The ReadingExperience is that within the main story column you can click on bold links to read a linked tiddler. Click on italic links within tiddlers to create a new tiddler, or use the 'new tiddler' button in the main menu. When you hover the mouse over a tiddler several ToolbarButtons appear. You can edit the text of any tiddler by double-clicking on it (or selecting 'edit' from the toolbar), but your changes won't get saved permanently until you make your own copy of TiddlyWiki, as described in SaveChanges.</div>

<div tiddler="Opera" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200510172311" created="200510172311" tags="browsers">TiddlyWiki includes code to allow you to SaveChanges under Opera. It requires some special settings to be made in Java's security policy file &quot;{{{.java.policy}}}&quot;. This file will not usually exist, and will need to be created manually.\n\nUnder Windows, the security policy file be at &quot;C:\sDocuments and Settings\syour-name\s.java.policy&quot;, and should look like this:\n{{{\ngrant codeBase &quot;file:/c:/tiddlywiki-folder/tiddlywiki.html&quot; {\n	permission java.io.FilePermission &quot;c:\s\stiddlywiki-folder\s\s*&quot;,\n&quot;read,write&quot;;\n};\n}}}\n\n@@So far, I haven't been able to get a working security policy file on the Mac; any assistance gratefully received@@. The policy file will be at &quot;/Users/your-name/.java.policy&quot; (note that the period at the start of the filename makes it invisible to the Finder). It should look like this:\n{{{\ngrant codeBase &quot;file://localhost/Users/jeremy/Sites/tiddlywiki.com/index.html&quot; {\n	permission java.io.FilePermission &quot;/Users/jeremy/Sites/tiddlywiki.com/*&quot;,&quot;read,write&quot;;\n};\n}}}\n\nThanks to Andrew Gregory for the [[original code|http://my.opera.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=91372]] to support Opera, and his subsequent patient support.\n\nThere are some minor issues with Opera:\n* The GradientMacro doesn't work at all</div>

<div tiddler="GettingStarted" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200611031850" created="200508181410" tags="instructions">The easiest way to learn about TiddlyWiki is to use it! Try clicking on various links and see what happens - you cannot damage tiddlywiki.com or your browser. One tip is to use the &lt;&lt;closeAll&gt;&gt; button over on the right to clear all the displayed tiddlers and start again.\n\nWhen you're ready to create your own TiddlyWiki on your computer, follow the instructions in DownloadSoftware and SaveChanges. There is also a free hosted service at http://tiddlyspot.com/ that makes it easier to share your TiddlyWiki with others (for more demanding applications there are several other ServerSide solutions available). If you're totally confused, you might find LeonKilat's [[video tutorial|http://max.limpag.com/2006/09/07/using-a-tiddlywiki-a-video-guide/]] useful.\n\nThere is some great introductory and advanced TiddlyWiki guide material at [[tiddlywikiguides.org|http://tiddlywikiguides.org/]], run by SimonBaird and DanielBaird. Simon and Daniel also have a regularly updated [[FAQ|http://twfaq.tiddlyspot.com/]], and JimBarr has an older collection of tips at [[TiddlyWikiTips|http://tiddlywikitips.com/]].</div>

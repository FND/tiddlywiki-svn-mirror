<div tiddler="GettingStarted" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200612272357" created="200508181410" tags="instructions" changecount="3">The easiest way to learn about TiddlyWiki is to use it! Try clicking on various links and see what happens - you cannot damage tiddlywiki.com or your browser. One tip is to use the &lt;&lt;closeAll&gt;&gt; button over on the right to clear all the displayed tiddlers and start again. Dave Gifford has prepared a new beginners guide: &quot;[[TiddlyWiki for the Rest of Us|http://www.giffmex.org/twfortherestofus.html]]&quot;. There's also MorrisGray's excellent [[TW Help - TiddlyWiki help file for beginners|http://tiddlyspot.com/twhelp/]]\n\nWhen you're ready to create your own TiddlyWiki on your computer, follow the instructions in DownloadSoftware and SaveChanges. There is also a free hosted service at http://tiddlyspot.com/ that makes it easier to share your TiddlyWiki with others (for more demanding applications there are several other ServerSide solutions available). If you're totally confused, you might find LeonKilat's [[video tutorial|http://max.limpag.com/2006/09/07/using-a-tiddlywiki-a-video-guide/]] useful.\n\nThere is some great introductory and advanced TiddlyWiki guide material at [[tiddlywikiguides.org|http://tiddlywikiguides.org/]], run by SimonBaird and DanielBaird. Simon and Daniel also have a regularly updated [[FAQ|http://twfaq.tiddlyspot.com/]], and JimBarr has an older collection of tips at [[TiddlyWikiTips|http://tiddlywikitips.com/]].</div>

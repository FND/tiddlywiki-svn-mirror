<div tiddler="CharacterEncoding" modifier="DaveBirss" modified="200507121058" created="200507121058" tags="troubleshooting">When you upload a TiddlyWiki to a web server, if doesn't load properly, it may be a CharacterEncoding issue.\n\nTiddlyWiki uses Unicode ~UTF-8 encoding and won't load properly if your host is serving it as ~ISO-8859-1. You should be able to check this by loading another page on the server in FireFox and selecting 'Page Info' on the 'Tools' menu.\n\nIf this is the case, it should be reasonably easy to sort out. We recommend that you contact your server host and ask them to serve it in ~UTF-8 mode. If you are more technically hands-on, you may be able to [[solve the issue yourself|http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-htaccess-charset]].</div>

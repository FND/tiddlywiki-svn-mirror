<pre>Within a CustomStyleSheet, you can include the text of another tiddler by including it in double square brackets. For example, if the tiddler MyFavouriteColour contains {{{#ff763e}}}, and the StyleSheet tiddler contained:

{{{
#mainMenu {background-color:[[MyFavouriteColour]];}
}}}

Then, the effect is that each CSS declaration will be set to {{{background-color: #ff763e;}}}.

In practice, for small bits of text like a colour, it makes sense to use TiddlerSlicing format to reference a chunk of text within a tiddler. See ColorPalette and StyleSheetColors for an example.

Of course, you can use this mechanism to redirect any part of a stylesheet, not just colours. And you can nest references for more complex effects.</pre>

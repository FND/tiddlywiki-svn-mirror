<div tiddler="NestedStyleSheets" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200609291535" created="200508181418" tags="features">Within a CustomStyleSheet, you can include the text of another tiddler by including it in double square brackets. For example, if the tiddler MyFavouriteColour contains {{{#ff763e}}}, and the StyleSheet tiddler contained:\n\n{{{\n#mainMenu {background-color:[[MyFavouriteColour]];}\n}}}\n\nThen, the effect is that each CSS declaration will be set to {{{background-color: #ff763e;}}}.\n\nIn practice, for small bits of text like a colour, it makes sense to use TiddlerSlicing format to reference a chunk of text within a tiddler. See ColorPalette and StyleSheetColors for an example.\n\nOf course, you can use this mechanism to redirect any part of a stylesheet, not just colours. And you can nest references for more complex effects.</div>

<div tiddler="NestedStyleSheets" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200508181418" created="200508181418" tags="features">Within a CustomStyleSheet, you can include the text of another tiddler by including it in double square brackets. For example, if the tiddler MyFavouriteColour contains {{{#ff763e}}}, and the StyleSheet tiddler contained:\n\n{{{\n#mainMenu {background-color:[[MyFavouriteColour]];}\n#sidebarOptions {background-color: [[MyFavouriteColour]];}\n#sidebarTabs {background-color: [[MyFavouriteColour]];}\n}}}\n\nThen, the effect is that each CSS declaration will be set to {{{background-color: #ff763e;}}}. The benefit is that if your favourite colour should change, it's only got to be modified in one place.\n\nOf course, you can use this mechanism to redirect any part of a stylesheet, not just colours. And you can nest references for more complex effects.</div>

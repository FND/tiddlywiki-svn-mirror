<div tiddler="BlockQuotes" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200609291350" created="200509200116" tags="formatting">To make quoted bits of text stand out, you can use BlockQuotes within your [[tiddler]]s, like this:\n\nJeremyRuston said:\n&lt;&lt;&lt;\nA TiddlyWiki is like a blog because it's divided up into neat little chunks, but it encourages you to read it by hyperlinking rather than sequentially: if you like, a non-linear blog analogue that binds the individual microcontent items into a cohesive whole.\n&lt;&lt;&lt;\n\nLike BulletPoints and NumberedBulletPoints, you can have multiple levels of BlockQuotes. Just edit this tiddler to see how it's done.\n\n&gt;level 1\n&gt;level 1\n&gt;&gt;level 2\n&gt;&gt;level 2\n&gt;&gt;&gt;level 3\n&gt;&gt;&gt;level 3\n&gt;&gt;level 2\n&gt;level 1\n</div>

<div tiddler="TiddlySaver" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200608250852" created="200608211539" tags="">The TiddlySaver applet is a small file named [[&quot;TiddlySaver.jar&quot;|TiddlySaver.jar]] that must be placed in the same directory as your TiddlyWiki file. Before you can use it, you need to give it the necessary privileges by editting your {{{.java.policy}}} file.\n\nFor Windows, the file will be at {{{C:\sDocuments and Settings\syour-user-name\s.java.policy}}}. Add the following lines (substituting the directory of your TiddlyWiki file as appropriate):\n{{{\ngrant codeBase &quot;file:${user.home}/My Documents/tiddlywiki-folder/*&quot; {\n  permission java.io.FilePermission &quot;${user.home}${/}My Documents${/}tiddlywiki-folder${/}*&quot;, &quot;read,write&quot;;\n};\n}}}\nOn Mac OS X, the file is found at {{{/Users/your-user-name/.java.policy}}}:\n{{{\ngrant codeBase &quot;file:${user.home}/Documents/tiddlywiki-folder/*&quot; {\n  permission java.io.FilePermission &quot;${user.home}${/}Documents${/}tiddlywiki-folder${/}*&quot;, &quot;read,write&quot;;\n};\n}}}\nIt can be tricky creating files whose name starts with a period, so you can use this [[pre-built .java.policy file|.java.policy]]. The same file is suitable for Macs too, just edit it and delete the &quot;My &quot; bit, leaving just &quot;Documents&quot;. Make sure you save it in the right place for each operating system!\n</div>

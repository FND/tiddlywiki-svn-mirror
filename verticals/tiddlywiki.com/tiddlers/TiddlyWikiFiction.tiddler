<pre>TiddlyWiki has been used as the basis of a couple of experiments in hypertext fiction right from the start GinaTrapani created [[Baby Dog Sitter|http://scribbling.net/tiddlywiki-and-non-linear-fiction]] with the FirstVersion of TiddlyWiki, followed by &quot;[[Die, Vampire! Die!|http://www.davidvanwert.com/wiki/dievampiredie.html]]&quot; from DavidVanWert and AlexSchroeders [[Rose|http://www.emacswiki.org/alex/rose.html]].

Perhaps the most ambitious and sustained experiment is Gimcrack'd (http://gimcrackd.com/), and CharlesStross' [[Singularity!|http://www.accelerando.org/_static/toughguide.html]] is a fun read.</pre>

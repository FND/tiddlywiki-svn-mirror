<div tiddler="AutoSave" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200508181342" created="200508181342" tags="options">If you check this box in the InterfaceOptions, TiddlyWiki will automatically SaveChanges every time you edit a tiddler. In that way there's a lot less chance of you losing any information. \n\nHowever, if you also have the SaveBackups checkbox ticked, you'll end up with a lot of archived files. You may prefer to select either one or the other.</div>

<pre>With the ServerAdaptorMechanism, TiddlyWiki adopts a simple model for interacting with servers:
* //Server adaptors// are plugins that provide a standardised interface to a particular server architecture. As standard, TiddlyWiki provides the FileAdaptor for talking to static TiddlyWiki files but others are available for talking to popular wiki servers
* A //host// string identifies a particular server, usually by it's URL
* A //workspace// string identifies a particular compartment or storage area within a server, for instance the name of a wiki on a shared MediaWiki server
* A //title// identifies a tiddler within a particular workspace
Via the ServerAdaptorExtendedFields, particular tiddlers can have a connection to a particular server.</pre>

<div tiddler="TiddlyWiki" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200601051540" created="200508181435" tags="concepts">A TiddlyWiki is like a blog because it's divided up into neat little chunks, but it encourages you to read it by hyperlinking rather than sequentially: if you like, a non-linear blog analogue that binds the individual microcontent items into a cohesive whole. I think that TiddlyWiki represents a novel medium for writing, and will promote its own distinctive WritingStyle.</div>

<div tiddler="HowToUpgrade" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200602231141" created="200508181412" tags="instructions">The core TiddlyWiki code is regularly updated with bug fixes and	 new features. If you're using an earlier revision of TiddlyWiki, here's the simple way to upgrade to the latest version:\n* Open your TiddlyWiki file in FireFox (say it's called &quot;mystuff.html&quot;)\n* SaveChanges (with SaveBackups switched on) to make sure that you've got a backup of it\n* Without closing that page, right-click on [[this link|http://www.tiddlywiki.com/empty.html]], select 'Save target' or 'Save link' and save it as &quot;mystuff.html&quot;, replacing your existing file\n* Now go back to the previously opened copy of &quot;mystuff.html&quot; in your browser and SaveChanges again. It will inherit the newly saved code\n* Refresh the page in the browser to verify that the upgrade has worked\nThe most likely cause of the upgrade process not working properly is that one of the [[Plugins]] you're using is not compatible with a change in the new release. If so, you can use the [[ImportTiddlersPlugin|http://www.tiddlytools.com/#ImportTiddlersPlugin]] from TiddlyTools to selectively import your content and [[Plugins]] into a new empty TiddlyWiki. </div>

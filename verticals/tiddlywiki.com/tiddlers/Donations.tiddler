<pre>TiddlyWiki is now owned by UnaMesa, a non-profit foundation. Part of it's purpose is to provide a means for people who enjoy using TiddlyWiki to usefully reward the members of the community who have helped to create it, and so we will be exploring ways of accepting and distributing donations. For the moment, we don't have a formal scheme, but would encourage people to donate directly to individuals where they can.

On a personal note (writes JeremyRuston), in the two years that I had a personal donation account before I took up a [[commercial position with BT|http://jermolene.wordpress.com/2007/05/29/i-for-one-welcome-my-new-bt-overlords/]], just under a 100 people donated a total of nearly Â£1500 via PayPal. Knowing how much effort it is to make such a payment, I'm truly grateful to everyone who took the trouble, many thanks. I used the money to buy camera equipment, a [[hobby|http://flickr.com/photos/jermy]] that I couldn't have pursued at the time otherwise.

If you find it useful, you can support it by contributing to the discussion groups, reporting bugs, or making a [[cash contribution via PayPal|https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=jeremy%40osmosoft%2ecom&amp;item_name=TiddlyWiki%20Donations&amp;no_shipping=0&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;charset=UTF%2d8]].   If you use TiddlyWiki regularly, you can share in the ownership of TiddlyWiki by making the suggested donation of half a days wages. If enough people become [[Stakeholders]], the formal ownership of the core TiddlyWiki code will be transferred to the community.\n\nIf you work for a commercial organisation that's using TiddlyWiki internally or distributing it as part of your own product, you might also consider making a corporate donation or working with [[Osmosoft|http://www.osmosoft.com/]] via a consultancy engagement.\n\nFinally, everyone helps the project by spreading the word, and encouraging more people to try out TiddlyWiki.</div>

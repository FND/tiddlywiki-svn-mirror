<div tiddler="Donations" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200605111137" created="200508181434" tags="welcome">Under its OpenSourceLicense, TiddlyWiki is available for anyone to use for free, and it always will be. If you enjoy it, or find it useful, you can choose to make a [[donation via PayPal|https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=jeremy%40osmosoft%2ecom&amp;item_name=TiddlyWiki%20Donations&amp;no_shipping=0&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;charset=UTF%2d8]].  (If you work for a big company that's using TiddlyWiki internally, you might also consider making a corporate donation or, as RicohInnovations have done, hiring me for a consultancy engagement through [[Osmosoft|http://www.osmosoft.com/]]).\n\nI'm very happy to say that by May 2006, a total of 62 generous donors have given just over £1,000, with almost half of it given over the last two months. The total amount donated by 8th May 2006 was £1,085.59, of which £53.35 was retained by PayPal, leaving £1,032.24. The amounts donated per month from July 2005 to May 2006 were &lt;&lt;sparkline 5650 5650 8050 8050 13000 13000 1800 1800 5753 5753 4000 4000 4000 4000 8994 8994 14862 14862 14450 14450 28000 28000&gt;&gt;. Rather than spending it all on beer, I'm planning to use the money to purchase a better digital camera to support my interest in [[photography|http://www.flickr.com/photos/jermy/]]. I'm thinking about a [[Canon EOS 350D Digital SLR|http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0007R6CHQ/qid=1147347291/sr=8-2/ref=pd_ka_2/203-6241463-2583925]] with a lens or two - I'm particularly keen to play with a [[tilt-shift lens|http://www.metropolismag.com/cda/story.php?artid=1760]].\n\nWhether or not you choose to make a financial donation to me, you can still help the project by joining the [[Community]] or just by spreading the word, and encouraging more people to try out TiddlyWiki.</div>

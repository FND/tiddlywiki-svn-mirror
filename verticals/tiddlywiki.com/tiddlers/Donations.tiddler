<div tiddler="Donations" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200603221705" created="200508181434" tags="welcome">Under it's OpenSourceLicense, TiddlyWiki is available for anyone to use for free, and it always will be. In the 9 months since I opened a [[donations account at PayPal|https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=jeremy%40osmosoft%2ecom&amp;item_name=TiddlyWiki%20Donations&amp;no_shipping=0&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;charset=UTF%2d8]] I'm grateful to have received a whisker over £500 (roughly $880 or €730). If you use TiddlyWiki regularly, or even if you just think it's cool, you can help me by adding your own [[donation|https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=jeremy%40osmosoft%2ecom&amp;item_name=TiddlyWiki%20Donations&amp;no_shipping=0&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;charset=UTF%2d8]], however modest.\n\nIf you work for a big company that's using TiddlyWiki internally, you might also consider making a corporate donation or, as RicohInnovations have done, hiring me for a consultancy engagement through [[Osmosoft|http://www.osmosoft.com/]].\n\nWhether or not you choose to make a financial donation to me, you can still help the project by joining the [[Community]] or just by spreading the word, and encouraging more people to try out TiddlyWiki.</div>

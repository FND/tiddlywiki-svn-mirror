<div tiddler="ServicePack2Problems" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200703271336" created="200509220051" tags="instructions issues troubleshooting">Internet Explorer Windows XP SP2 seems to have a magical ability to keep track of html files that have been downloaded from the internet and saved on an NTFS drive. By storing additional data in an [[alternate data stream|http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/FileAndDisk/Streams.mspx]], it manages to keep them in the 'Internet' zone regardless of attempts to rename or modify the file. But, in order to be able to SaveChanges, TiddlyWiki needs to run in the 'My Computer' zone.\n\nThe solution is to right-click on the TiddlyWiki html file and choose //Properties//. If the file is blocked, you'll see an 'Unblock' button on the resulting property sheet that removes the protection and allows the file to open in the 'My Computer' zone. Then open the file in Internet Explorer - it might put up its information bar asking you whether you want to run it. You need to 'Allow blocked content' to let TiddlyWiki do its stuff.\n&lt;&lt;&lt;\nIf you find yourself running into the information bar frequently, you can disable it by visiting the &quot;Options&quot; dialog and, on the &quot;Advanced&quot; tab make sure that &quot;Allow active content to run in files on My Computer&quot; is checked.\n\nAlternatively, you can rename the file to {{{*.hta}}} which has the added bonus of automatically granting all necessary save permissions.\n&lt;&lt;&lt;\nThis is all a bit frustrating. An easy alternative is to use FireFox, which seems to do the trick on all platforms.</div>

<div tiddler="Plugins" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200702011147" created="200512170953" tags="community concepts">TiddlyWiki can be extended by InstallingPlugins that implement new [[Macros]], [[Themes]], [[Tweaks]] or other features. The easiest way of InstallingPlugins is to use ImportTiddlers. Like other features that need to modify TiddlyWiki files, it only works when TiddlyWiki is loaded from a {{{file://}}} URL.\n\nSome of the leading plugin sites from independent developers are here tagged as &lt;&lt;tag contentPublisher&gt;&gt; which also makes them available in ImportTiddlers.\n\nChrisKlimas has written [[The Macrocodex|http://gimcrackd.com/etc/src/codex/]], some superb documentation on writing plugins and macros for TiddlyWiki.</div>

<pre>TiddlyWiki can be extended by InstallingPlugins that implement new [[Macros]], [[Themes]], [[Tweaks]] or other features. The easiest way of InstallingPlugins is to use ImportTiddlers. Like other features that need to modify TiddlyWiki files, it only works when TiddlyWiki is loaded from a {{{file://}}} URL.

DaveGifford oversees an extensive catalogue of available plugins at [[TiddlyVault|http://tiddlyvault.tiddlyspot.com/]].

Some of the leading plugin sites from independent developers are here tagged as &lt;&lt;tag systemServer&gt;&gt; which also makes them available in ImportTiddlers.

ChrisKlimas has written [[The Macrocodex|http://gimcrackd.com/etc/src/codex/]], some superb documentation on writing plugins and macros for TiddlyWiki.</pre>

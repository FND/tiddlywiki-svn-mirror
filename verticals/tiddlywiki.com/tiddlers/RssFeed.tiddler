<div tiddler="RssFeed" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200507121730" created="200507121730" tags="features">TiddlyWiki's RSS feed is available [[here|http://www.tiddlywiki.com/index.xml]]. RSS support is a WorkInProgress that lacks some niceties at the moment (in particular, the feed is plain text rather than incorporating links and formatting), but at least makes it easier to track changes. You can generate an RSS feed for your own TiddlyWiki using the GenerateAnRssFeed option.</div>

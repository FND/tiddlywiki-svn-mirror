<div tiddler="FireFox" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200609101232" created="200508181151" tags="browsers issues">FireFox lets you SaveChanges in TiddlyWiki, but you will see up to three dialogs asking your permission for the local file operations. You must allow all three operations for it to work properly. Note that you can select the //Remember this decision// option to avoid seeing the dialogs in future.\n&lt;&lt;&lt;\nYou can run into problems if you accidentally click 'Deny' on the dialog, and select //Remember this decision//.\n\nTo reverse the effects, first locate the file {{{prefs.js}}} in your FireFox profile directory. Under Windows you'll find it at something like {{{C:\sDocuments and Settings\sJeremy\sApplication Data\sMozilla\sFirefox\sProfiles\so3dhupu6.default\sprefs.js}}}, where {{{Jeremy}}} is the name of your windows profile and {{{o3dhupu6}}} will be a similar string of gobbledegook. On the Mac it'll be at {{{~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/o3dhupu6.default/prefs.js}}} and on most versions of Linux, at {{{~/.mozilla/firefox/o3dhupu6.default/prefs.js}}}.\n\nOpen the file in a text editor and find the line {{{user_pref(&quot;capability.principal.codebase.p0.denied&quot;, &quot;UniversalXPConnect&quot;);}}} and simply replace the word {{{denied}}} with {{{granted}}}.\n//(Thanks to JonScully for figuring out this fix)//\n&lt;&lt;&lt;\n\nFireFox users should be aware that GreaseMonkey can break TiddlyWiki. There's also a rather unpredictable FireFoxKeyboardIssue.</div>

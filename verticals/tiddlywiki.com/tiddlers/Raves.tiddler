<pre>&quot;TiddlyWiki offers a glimpse of how things are changing in terms of how people think about software... a new beginning for simple software.&quot; -- //Jeremy Wagstaff, [[WSJ.com|http://groups.google.com/group/TiddlyWiki/browse_thread/thread/53c7b7686b9bb5c2/122f1b2146d2ba6d?q=wsj&amp;rnum=1]]//

&quot;The original TiddlyWiki by Jeremy Ruston is, without a doubt, one of the most amazing dynamic web apps I've ever seen (sorry Gmail.)&quot; -- [[Lifehacker.com recommendation|http://www.lifehacker.com/software/productivity/getting-things-done-tiddlywiki-102953.php]]

&quot;It's blowing my mind.&quot; -- //Evan Williams, founder of Blogger and Odeo, [[EvHead|http://evhead.com/2005/05/tiddlywiki-reusable-non-linear.asp]]//

&quot;What I love most about Tiddlywiki is that it is quite easy to use but incredibly flexible.&quot; -- //Ed Sim of Dawntreader Ventures, [[BeyondVC|http://www.beyondvc.com/2005/10/tiddlywiki.html]]//

&quot;TiddlyWiki is completely blowing my mind... Completely tripped out. Try it and you'll see what I mean.&quot; -- //Russell Beattie of Yahoo!, [[Russell Beattie's Notebook|http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008896.html]]//

&quot;OK, this is the first wiki interface Iâ€™ve seen that has real potential. Dunno quite why exactly, but this blows my mind.&quot; -- //Jason Kottke, [[Kottke's Remaindered Links|http://www.kottke.org/remainder/04/09/6574.html]]//</pre>

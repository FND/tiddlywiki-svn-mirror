<div tiddler="SpecialTags" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200508181426" created="200508181426" tags="features">TiddlyWiki now defines a small number of SpecialTags that are used to indicate that tiddlers should be treated differently in some way:\n* ''excludeSearch'': excludes a tiddler from search results\n* ''excludeLists'': excludes a tiddler from the lists in the sidebar tabs\n* ''systemTiddler'': marks tiddlers whose content is used to create paraphernalia like the main menu, title and sidebar. These tiddlers are included if you use the SaveEmptyTemplate option\n* ''systemConfig'': marks tiddlers that contain JavaScript that should be executed once TiddlyWiki has loaded</div>

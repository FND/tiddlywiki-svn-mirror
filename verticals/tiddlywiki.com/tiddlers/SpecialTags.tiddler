<div tiddler="SpecialTags" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200606191214" created="200508181426" tags="features">TiddlyWiki defines a small number of SpecialTags that are used to indicate that tiddlers should be treated differently in some way:\n* ''excludeSearch'': excludes a tiddler from search results\n* ''excludeLists'': excludes a tiddler from the lists in the sidebar tabs\n* ''systemConfig'': marks tiddlers that contain JavaScript that should be executed once TiddlyWiki has loaded\n* ''excludeMissing'': excludes a tiddler from the processing that generates the MissingTiddlers list. Use it when you have a tiddler that contains links to missing tiddlers and you don't want those missing links to appear in the MissingTiddlers list</div>

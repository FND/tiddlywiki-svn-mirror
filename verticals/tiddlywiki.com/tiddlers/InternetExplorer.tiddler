<div tiddler="InternetExplorer" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200604181638" created="200509270114" tags="issues browsers">TiddlyWiki works on InternetExplorer 6.x and above under Windows. It also allows you to SaveChanges, albeit there are some annoying ServicePack2Problems to work around.\n\nKnown problems with TiddlyWiki under InternetExplorer:\n* [[Gradient]] fills sometimes appear in the wrong place until you move the mouse over the tiddler\n* Horizontal gradients don't work correctly\n* Links to tiddlers with multiple consecutive spaces in their titles is broken\n* Runs of spaces within tiddlers get conflated into a single space when you edit a tiddler. This is particularly annoying when using MonospacedText blocks\nPreliminary testing with InternetExplorer 7 Beta 2 suggests that TiddlyWiki will still work with the new version. However, the ActiveX control that TiddlyWiki uses to handle saving is no longer enabled by default. Internet Explorer prompts the user to re-enable it, but the process is fiddly and confusing.</div>

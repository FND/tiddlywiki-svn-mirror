<div tiddler="MinorChanges" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200509262334" created="200509262334" tags="">Sometimes it's useful to stop a minor change to a tiddler from causing it to rise to the top of the timeline. This can be done by pressing the Shift key while clicking the 'done' toolbar button, or with the ~Shift-Control-Enter key. This behaviour can be switched to become the default with one of the AdvancedOptions.</div>

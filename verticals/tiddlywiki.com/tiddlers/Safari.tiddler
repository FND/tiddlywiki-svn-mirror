<div tiddler="Safari" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200609291545" created="200511082101" tags="issues browsers">Safari can SaveChanges using the TiddlySaver Java applet.\n\nThere are still some issues with Safari:\n* The SiteTitle and SiteSubtitle don't get properly set in the browser window title bar\n* PermaLinks with Unicode characters in them (like [[this one|http://avm.free.fr/tidlipo.html#AdaptationFran%C3%A7aise]]) don't work properly\n* There's a strange display bug that can leave behind phantom tiddlers after editing (the workaround is to SaveChanges and then use 'refresh' in Safari to reload the page)\n* InterfaceOptions (like your UserName) are not 'sticky' across sessions, related to the way that cookies are handled by Safari for files loaded from 'file://' URLs.\n* Searching doesn't always get triggered correctly after typing in the search box\n* Vertically collapsed columns in HtmlTables do not work correctly</div>

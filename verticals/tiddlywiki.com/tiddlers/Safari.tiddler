<div tiddler="Safari" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200602231026" created="200511082101" tags="issues browsers">There is a plugin for Mac OS X Safari to enable it to SaveChanges. To install it, download [[this file|http://www.accela.net/~dankna/tiddlywiki/TiddlyWikiSaverPlugin.plugin.zip]], unzip it and put it in your {{{Library/Internet Plug-Ins}}} folder. Safari will throw up confirmation questions before allowing the plug-in to save anything.\n&lt;&lt;&lt;\nThe plug-in was originally written by JonathanPaisley and published at http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~jp/tiddlywiki/ and then improved by DanKnapp at http://www.accela.net/~dankna/tiddlywiki/\n&lt;&lt;&lt;\nThere are still some issues with Safari:\n* PermaLinks with Unicode characters in them (like [[this one|http://avm.free.fr/tidlipo.html#AdaptationFran%C3%A7aise]]) don't work properly\n* There's a strange display bug that can leave behind phantom tiddlers after editing (the workaround is to SaveChanges and then use 'refresh' in Safari to reload the page)\n* InterfaceOptions (like your UserName) are not 'sticky' across sessions, related to the way that cookies are handled by Safari for files loaded from 'file://' URLs.\n* Searching doesn't always get triggered correctly after typing in the search box\n* Vertically collapsed columns in HtmlTables do not work correctly</div>

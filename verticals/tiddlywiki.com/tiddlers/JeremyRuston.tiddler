I'm available for limited consultancy work through my company [[Osmosoft|http://www.osmosoft.com]] but, thanks to the support of RicohInnovations, most of my time is now taken up with developing and promoting TiddlyWiki.\n\nI can be reached at {{{jeremy (at) osmosoft (dot) com}}}, and I regularly read and reply to messages on the [[TiddlyWiki Google Groups|Community]]. You can also find me on [[Flickr|http://www.flickr.com/photos/jermy/]] and [[Technorati|http://technorati.com/claim/bwntx5ez7q]].</div>

It's geared towards DavidAllen's GettingThingsDone methodology for personal productivity. It's available [[here|http://shared.snapgrid.com/gtd_tiddlywiki.html]] and Nathan is also hosting a forum for discussions about it [[on his site|http://shared.snapgrid.com/gtd-forum/]].\n\nIf you want to have the GTD look-and-feel but still be able to use the latest TiddlyWiki features, check out the GTD Style at [[TiddlerWiki|http://checketts.objectis.net/wiki/]]</div>

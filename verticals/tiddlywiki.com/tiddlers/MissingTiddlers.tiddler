<div tiddler="MissingTiddlers" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200506101944" created="200506101944" tags="features">The 'Missing' option on the MoreTab shows you the names of tiddlers that you've referred to but not gone ahead to define. It can be useful during writing sessions to keep track of things you need to come back and fill out.\n\nThe MissingTab was requested by several users of TiddlyWiki, and was a motivation for rewriting the StorageModel.</div>

In these situations you can either use MonospacedText or you can accomplish the same thing without the monospaced effect like this:\n{{{\nThis is AnotherLink, this is a copyright symbol &amp;copy; and this site is called &lt;&lt;tiddler SiteTitle&gt;&gt;\n&lt;nowiki&gt;This is AnotherLink, this is a copyright symbol &amp;copy; and this site is called &lt;&lt;tiddler SiteTitle&gt;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;\n&quot;&quot;&quot;This is AnotherLink, this is a copyright symbol &amp;copy; and this site is called &lt;&lt;tiddler SiteTitle&gt;&gt;&quot;&quot;&quot;\n}}}\nWhich displays as:\nThis is AnotherLink, this is a copyright symbol &amp;copy; and this site is called &lt;&lt;tiddler SiteTitle&gt;&gt;\n&lt;nowiki&gt;This is AnotherLink, this is a copyright symbol &amp;copy; and this site is called &lt;&lt;tiddler SiteTitle&gt;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;\n&quot;&quot;&quot;This is AnotherLink, this is a copyright symbol &amp;copy; and this site is called &lt;&lt;tiddler SiteTitle&gt;&gt;&quot;&quot;&quot;</div>

<pre>Access keys are shortcuts to common functions accessed by typing a letter with either the 'alt' (PC) or 'control' (Mac) key:
|!PC|!Mac|!Function|
|Alt-F|Ctrl-F|Search|
|Alt-J|Ctrl-J|NewJournal|
|Alt-N|Ctrl-N|NewTiddler|
|Alt-S|Ctrl-S|SaveChanges|
These access keys are provided by the associated internal [[Macros]] for the functions above. The macro needs to be used in an open tiddler (or the MainMenu or SideBar) in order for the access keys to work.

While editing a tiddler:
* ~Control-Enter or ~Control-Return accepts your changes and switches out of editing mode (use ~Shift-Control-Enter or ~Shift-Control-Return to stop the date and time being updated for MinorChanges)
* Escape abandons your changes and reverts the tiddler to its previous state

In the search box:
* Escape clears the search term</pre>

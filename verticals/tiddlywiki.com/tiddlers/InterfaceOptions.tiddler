<div tiddler="InterfaceOptions" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200508181412" created="200508181412" tags="features options">InterfaceOptions are displayed when you click the 'options' button on the right. They are saved in a cookie on your browser, making them sticky between visits. RegExpSearch allows more complex search expressions; CaseSensitiveSearch does as its name implies. The user name for edits should be set //before// starting to edit things (ouch. another bug). AutoSave and SaveBackups give the option of automatically saving changes and whether to generate backup files. You can also choose to GenerateAnRssFeed.</div>

<div tiddler="SelfContained" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200510180005" created="200510180005" tags="features concepts">One of the neatest features of TiddlyWiki is that it is entirely self-contained in a single HTML file - even including graphics like the GradientMacro and [[Sparklines]]. The file contains the actual hypertext document, and the JavaScript, CascadingStyleSheets and HTML necessary to both view and edit it. This means that it is trivial to host a TiddlyWiki on a website, or to distribute one by email. And anyone with a reasonably recent web browser will be able to read and edit it.</div>

<div tiddler="ServerSide" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200606231337" created="200508181425" tags="concepts">Out of the box, TiddlyWiki doesn't have a ServerSide back end. In many applications that's a great strength because it means that you can work with TiddlyWiki without having to be connected to the Internet or, because it's SelfContained, installing any software.\n\nIn other applications, a ServerSide can be very useful, particularly if you want to edit a TiddlyWiki while it's online, or you need lots of people to be able to edit a TiddlyWiki at the same time. The development [[Community]] has come up with several ServerSide implementations that are suitable for a range of applications. The most popular and up-to-date ones that you can download and install on your own servers are:\n\n* [[ZiddlyWiki|http://www.ziddlywiki.org/]] from TimMorgan\n* [[ccTiddly|http://cctiddly.sourceforge.net/]] from CoolCold\n* [[PrinceTiddlyWiki|http://ptw.sourceforge.net/index-en.html]] from BramChen\n* [[RoWiki|http://rodney.gotdns.com/]] from RodneyGomes\n\n[[TiddlySpot|http://tiddlyspot.com]] offers a fantastic, free hosted version of TiddlyWiki with some very cool features (although at present it does not support simultaneous editting by multiple users). It's based on Bidix's remarkable [[UploadPlugin|http://tiddlywiki.bidix.info/#HowToUpload]].\n\nThere are also some TiddlyWikiAdaptations that have taken some of the code and ideas from TiddlyWiki and diverged off to do their own thing.</div>

<div tiddler="ServerSide" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200508181425" created="200508181425" tags="concepts">TiddlyWiki doesn't have a server-side back end at the moment, so when you SaveChanges you're saving the whole document, as you would with Microsoft Word. That means that it is essentially only really a SingleUser thing (unless it gets passed round as a ChainTiddlyWiki). There are several TiddlyWikiAdaptations that //do// have a ServerSide, though.</div>

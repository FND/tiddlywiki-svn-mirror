<pre>The [[Community]] is experimenting with using the [[del.icio.us|http://del.icio.us/]] bookmarking service as a PluginDirectory. The idea is to use the tag &quot;TiddlyWikiPlugin&quot; to identify the URL of a TiddlyWiki plugin. The del.icio.us fields should be set as follows:

|!Field |!Example |
|url |http://authorsite.com/#ThePlugin |
|title |ThePluginTitle |
|notes |Brief description/review of plugin |
|tags |TiddlyWikiPlugin &lt;AuthorName&gt; |

The beauty of this approach is that it aggregates together multiple comments about a single plugin. For example, this is the del.icio.us [[page about UdoBorkowski's YourSearch plugin|http://del.icio.us/url/8085cbf3bbeda20f39a04a2969616afd]]. You can also browse the tag directly to see recently added plugins: http://del.icio.us/tag/TiddlyWikiPlugin

BidiX has also created a special del.icio.us account (http://del.icio.us/TiddlyWikiPlugin) that he's using to compile a master list of plugins tagged with TiddlyWikiHackers.</pre>

<pre>Follow these steps to get started! These guidelines are for Internet Explorer 7.0 running on Microsoft Windows Vista 6.0.0. Hopefully they will be helpful for your setup too.

''If these guidelines aren't appropriate, check the [[other browser-specific guidelines|Installation]] to find some that are right for you.''
!Step 1 - Download file
You'll need to choose a name and location for your empty ~TiddlyWiki file - we recommend either your Desktop or Documents folder. Make sure you leave the "Save as type: HTML Document" default option as it is. Then click 'Save'.

!Step 2 - Open folder
Once the download has been completed, ''don't open the file yet'' - a minor modification is required before ~TiddlyWiki will work! Click on 'Open Folder'.

!Step 3 - Modify properties
In the folder, right click on the file name and select 'Properties' from the bottom of the contextual menu.

!Step 4 - Unblock file
In order to allow saving, you need to Unblock the file. Select 'Unblock' near the bottom of the dialogue box, then click on 'OK'.

!Step 5 - Open file
Double click on the file name to open the file. Internet Explorer takes special care to block javascript from untrusted sources, so a screen will appear with a yellow bar at the top and a warning in red. Click on the yellow bar (this will make it turn blue, as shown below), and select 'Allow Blocked Content...'.

!Step 6 - Allow active content
~TiddlyWiki contains 'active content' that, for example, allows search and tagging to function. Approve this active content by clicking on 'Yes'.

!Step 7 - Enable saving mechanism
One final hurdle! When you save for the first time, you'll be prompted to allow the activity. Click on 'Yes'.

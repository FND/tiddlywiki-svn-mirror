<pre>Out of the box, ~TiddlyWiki doesn't have a Server Side back end. In many applications that's a great strength because it means that you can work with ~TiddlyWiki without having to be connected to the Internet or, because it's SelfContained, installing any software.

In other applications, a ~ServerSide can be very useful, particularly if you want to edit a ~TiddlyWiki while it's online, or you need lots of people to be able to edit a ~TiddlyWiki at the same time. The development [[Community]] has come up with several ~ServerSide implementations that are suitable for a range of applications. The most popular and up-to-date ones that you can download and install on your own servers are:
* [[TiddlyWeb|http://www.tiddlywiki.org/wiki/TiddlyWeb]] in Python from Chris Dent
* [[Coral|https://coral.dev.java.net/]] in Java 
* [[ccTiddly|http://cctiddly.sourceforge.net/]] from Matthew So (aka ~CoolCold)
* [[PrinceTiddlyWiki|http://ptw.sourceforge.net/]] from Bram Chen
* [[ZiddlyWiki|http://www.ziddlywiki.org/]] from Bob ~McElrath and Tim Morgan
* [[PhpTiddlyWiki|http://www.patrickcurry.com/tiddly/]] from Patrick Curry

[[TiddlySpot|http://tiddlyspot.com]] offers a fantastic, free hosted version of ~TiddlyWiki with some very cool features (although at present it does not support simultaneous editing by multiple users). It's based on ~BidiX's remarkable [[UploadPlugin|http://tiddlywiki.bidix.info/#HowToUpload]].

There are also some TiddlyWikiAdaptations that have taken some of the code and ideas from ~TiddlyWiki and diverged off to do their own thing.</pre>

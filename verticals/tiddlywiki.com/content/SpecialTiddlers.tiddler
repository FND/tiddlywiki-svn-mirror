<pre>~TiddlyWiki uses several "special tiddlers" to perform a number of essential functions as follows:
*[[Configuration]] tiddlers configure the layout of the page, including the MainMenu, the SiteTitle, the SiteSubtitle and other features. 
*A tiddler called DefaultTiddlers is used to list the tiddlers that are shown at startup. 
*A tiddler called SaveChanges is automatically displayed if there's a problem with saving. Any of them can be edited with the changes taking effect immediately.</pre>

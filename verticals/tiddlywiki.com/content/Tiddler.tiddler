<pre>A 'tiddler' is the name given to a unit of MicroContent in TiddlyWiki.

Tiddlers are pervasive in TiddlyWiki. The MainMenu is defined by a tiddler, plugins are delivered in tiddlers, there are special StyleSheet tiddlers, and so on.

Other systems have analogous concepts with more prosaic names: like "items", "entries", "entities". Even though "tiddler" is undoubtedly a SillyName it at least has the virtue of being confusingly distinctive rather than confusingly generic.</pre>

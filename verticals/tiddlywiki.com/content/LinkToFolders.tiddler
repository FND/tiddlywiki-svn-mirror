<pre>The format for PrettyLinks allows for links that open local or network folders. Depending on your browser and operating system, the folders are opened in Windows Explorer, the OS X Finder, or the browser itself.

Edit this tiddler to see [[this link to a Windows network share|file://///server/share/folder/path/name]], [[this link to a Windows drive-mapped folder|file:///c:/folder/path/name]] and [[this link to a Unix-style folder|file:///folder/path/name]].</pre>

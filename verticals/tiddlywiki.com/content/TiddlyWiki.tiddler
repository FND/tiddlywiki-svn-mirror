<pre>~TiddlyWiki is a complete [[wiki|WikiWikiWeb]] in a single HTML file. It contains the entire text of the wiki, and all the ~JavaScript, CSS and HTML goodness to be able to display it, and let you edit it or search it - without needing a server. Although, having said that, there are some fine ServerSide adaptations out there.

~TiddlyWiki is published under an OpenSourceLicense and maintained by a busy [[Community|Help and Support]] of independent developers.</pre>

<pre>IsaoSonobe's TiddlyWikiPod is a nifty utility for Mac OS X that copies the content of a TiddlyWiki to an iPod where it can be read, and links followed, using the touch wheel. Isao has also added the ability to link to songs from the TiddlyWiki text which enables some interesting applications. At the moment, the instructions apply to the older SecondVersion of TiddlyWiki. It can be found at http://www8.ocn.ne.jp/~sonoisa/TiddlyWikiPod/index.html</pre>

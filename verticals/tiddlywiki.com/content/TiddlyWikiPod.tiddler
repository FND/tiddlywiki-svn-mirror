<pre>Isao Sonobe's [[TiddlyWikiPod|http://www8.ocn.ne.jp/~sonoisa/TiddlyWikiPod/index.html]] is a nifty utility for Mac OS X that copies the content of a ~TiddlyWiki to an iPod where it can be read, and links followed, using the touch wheel. Isao has also added the ability to link to songs from the ~TiddlyWiki text which enables some interesting applications. At the moment, the instructions apply to the older SecondVersion of ~TiddlyWiki.</pre>

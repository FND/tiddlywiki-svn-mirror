<pre>I'm the original creator of TiddlyWiki (nowadays, it's more of a [[group effort|Community]]). I work at [[BT|http://www.btplc.com/]] where I am Head of Open Source Innovation. I run the [[Osmosoft]] team, and generally try to help BT be better at understanding and participating in open source.

I can be reached at {{{jeremy (at) osmosoft (dot) com}}}, and I regularly read and reply to messages on the [[TiddlyWiki Google Groups|Community]]. I (occasionally) blog at http://jermolene.wordpress.com/ and you can also find me on [[Flickr|http://www.flickr.com/photos/jermy/]], [[del.icio.us|http://del.icio.us/jeremyruston]] and [[twitter|http://twitter.com/Jermolene]].</pre>

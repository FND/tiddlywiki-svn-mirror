* Friendlier customisation of ToolbarCommands
* Improvements to the ImportTiddlers user interface
* Added warning before closing a dirty tiddler
* Enhanced GradientMacro
* Enhanced tag chooser to allow selection of multiple tags by control-clicking on them
!!! Performance
* Speeded up ~SHA-1 hash function
!!! Hackability
As usual, several of the new features are intended to make life easier for plugin writers and other TiddlyWiki hackers:
* Several enhancements to the {{{<<view>>}}} macro
* Support for nested popups
* Improved SafeMode that now protects the shadow tiddlers
* Added support for temporary tiddlers via the {{{doNotSave()}}} method on the {{{Tiddler}}} object
* Added W3C locale specifier
* Several new CSS classes for easier restyling (eg the "tabsetWrapper" class for tabs)
TiddlyWiki benefits from an extensive set of [[translations|http://trac.tiddlywiki.org/wiki/Translations]]. There are several enhancements in this release to make it easier to maintain translations.</pre>

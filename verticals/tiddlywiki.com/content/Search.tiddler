<pre>The basic version of ~TiddlyWiki includes standard search functionality. Using this standard functionality, when a search term is entered, all tiddlers that contain this term are opened, with the search term highlighted wherever it appears.

However, thanks to the [[plugin architecture|Plugins]] of ~TiddlyWiki, the [[community|Help and Support]] has written a number of search plugins which can be installed on your local ~TiddlyWiki files easily. The most popular search plugins are:
*Eric Shulman's ~SearchOptionsPlugin - a highly configurable plugin that produces a list of tiddler titles with options for advanced searches. Available at http://www.TiddlyTools.com/#SearchOptionsPlugin
*Udo Borkowski's ~YourSearchPlugin - opens the search results in a large iFrame in the same style as Google (result, then synopsis). Available at http://tiddlywiki.abego-software.de/
*Frederik Dohr's ~SimpleSearchPlugin (which this site is using) - copy and paste the code on [[this page|http://svn.tiddlywiki.org/Trunk/contributors/FND/plugins/SimpleSearchPlugin.js]] into a new tiddler, tagthe tiddler with systemConfig, and save / re-open your ~TiddlyWiki.

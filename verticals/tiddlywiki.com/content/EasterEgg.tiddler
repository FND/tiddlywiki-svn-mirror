<pre>Try holding down the alt- or shift-key while clicking on a link to a tiddler, on the 'options' button or on the CloseButton for a tiddler. Kind of a respectful homage to Mac OS X, which does something similar for many of its system animations. (On browsers like InternetExplorer that use the shift key to open a new window, it's best to use the alt-key).</pre>

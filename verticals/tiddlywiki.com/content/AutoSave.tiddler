<pre>If you check this box in the InterfaceOptions, TiddlyWiki will automatically SaveChanges every time you edit a tiddler. In that way there's a lot less chance of you losing any information. 

However, if you also have the SaveBackups checkbox ticked, you'll end up with a lot of archived files. You may prefer to select either one or the other.</pre>

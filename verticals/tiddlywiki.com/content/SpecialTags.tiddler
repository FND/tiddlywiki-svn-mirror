<pre>TiddlyWiki defines a small number of SpecialTags that are used to indicate that tiddlers should be treated differently in some way:
* ''excludeSearch'': excludes a tiddler from search results
* ''excludeLists'': excludes a tiddler from the lists in the sidebar tabs
* ''systemConfig'': marks tiddlers that contain JavaScript that should be executed once TiddlyWiki has loaded
* ''excludeMissing'': excludes a tiddler from the processing that generates the MissingTiddlers list. Use it when you have a tiddler that contains links to missing tiddlers and you don't want those missing links to appear in the MissingTiddlers list</pre>

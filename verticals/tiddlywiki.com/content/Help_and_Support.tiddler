<pre>[>img[tiddlywiki.org logo|http://trac.tiddlywiki.org/chrome/site/tworg_logo_med.jpg][http://www.tiddlywiki.org]]~TiddlyWiki today is the result of the efforts of dozens of people around the world generously contributing their time and skill, and offering considerable help and support. 

If you'd like help getting your ~TiddlyWiki project off the ground, perhaps the best place to start is the community wiki at http://www.tiddlywiki.org. It contains detailed project documentation, as well as the master copy of the ~TiddlyWiki source code, and a system for tracking bugs and enhancement requests. The community welcomes [[contributions|Contribute]].

Also, there are two Google Group discussion forums for discussions about ~TiddlyWiki, whether basic entry level questions or more complex challenges! They are the best places to ask questions about ~TiddlyWiki, and to connect with other enthusiasts:
* A ~TiddlyWiki group for general discussion, bug reports and announcements at http://groups.google.com/group/TiddlyWiki
* A ~TiddlyWikiDev group for discussion about ~TiddlyWiki development at http://groups.google.com/group/TiddlyWikiDev
There are also resources for non-English language speakers,
* ~TiddlyWikiFR, in French, at http://groups.google.com/group/TiddlyWikiFR

Many ~TiddlyWiki hackers hang out on our IRC room, #tiddlywiki on irc.freenode.net.

<pre>To import tiddlers from another ~TiddlyWiki file, or from an external website, follow these instructions.
#If the tiddler is on an external site, first copy the URL of the site which includes the tiddler you'd like to download into your clipboard (eg http://www.tiddlytools.com)
#Open your local ~TiddlyWiki file from your computer.
#Click on the 'Backstage' link that you can see at the very top right hand side of the page.
#In the menu, click on 'Import'. You will then see a window that looks like this - and you can follow the guidance from there. Note that you may need to grant authorisation to your ~TiddlyWiki file to import tiddlers - this is fine and expected.

//Note also that the popular [[Firebug|http://www.joehewitt.com/software/firebug/]] extension for Firefox interferes with ImportTiddlers if its "Show XMLHttpRequest" option is switched on//</pre>

TiddlyWiki standard distribution

This directory contains what is required to build a distribution of TiddlyWiki.
The recipes are contained in the corresponding directory, e.g.:
    recipes/index.2.4.2.html.recipe
    recipes/empty.2.4.2.html.recipe
(This document assumes the release is version 2.4.2.)

These recipes are used to build tiddlywiki.com and an empty TiddlyWiki.
The script "bld" can be used to cook these recipes.
Files are created in /cooked.

In preparation for a release, the following steps need to be taken:
* set version number in Trunk/core/js/Version.js
* create recipe in Trunk/core/recipes/
* if applicable, update copyright notices (in core/html/copyright.txt and
  verticals/tiddlywiki.com/shadows/MainMenu.tiddler)
* update build and upload scripts to use the respective version number
* update tiddlywiki.com vertical's recipes
* update tiddlywiki.com vertical's NewFeatures tiddler (including modified date)
* tag release to Tags/core/:
  svn copy http://svn.tiddlywiki.org/Trunk/core http://svn.tiddlywiki.org/Tags/core/REL-2.4.2_Final

After building, the "index" document needs to be saved in the browser once to
set the title and generate the RSS feed.

For 2.4.2 these need to be cooked and the resultant TiddlyWikis copied onto the
server as follows:
    index.2.4.2.html => http://www.tiddlywiki.com/index.html
    empty.2.4.2.html => http://www.tiddlywiki.com/empty.html
    empty.2.4.2.html => http://www.tiddlywiki.com/upgrade/index.html
    nobeta.html      => http://www.tiddlywiki.com/beta/index.html
The script "upload" can be used to upload the index and empty documents onto
the tiddlywiki.com server (you will be prompted for username and password twice).

Immediately after a release, the version number should be increased and marked
as alpha.

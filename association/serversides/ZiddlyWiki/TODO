Some ideas for ways to improve ZiddlyWiki.  If you want one of the below
featuers, feel free to work on it and send a patch th
TiddlyWikiDev@googlegroups.com!  See:
    http://www.ziddlywiki.org/#ZiddlyContributions
for instructions on how to make a patch file.

* Display a message if a newer revision is available on "view"

* Check if someone is editing a tiddler when it is being displayed.  Grey out
    edit button or something, or change it to 'editing: Joe'...

* An empty edit generates a lock, and forces all users to reload the tiddler.

* Make these locks compatible with WEBDAV locks:

    It seems WebDAV locks can't obtain the identity of the person holding
    the lock.

    Again, could use lock_user as an object attribute, but that incurs a
    history change and revisionKey change.

* Make an external editor link on the toolbar if it's configured (use DTML to
    modify the default ViewTemplate)

* The core uses store.dirty to indicate that the wiki needs to be saved.  This
  functionality is essentially disabled right now.  Instead we need a
  "saveFailed" flag which indicates that the current store has changes that
  were not uploaded.  First we should try to re-upload those changes (in case
  the network went down), and we should issue the "Unsaved Changes" dialog if
  the user tries to leave the page.


* 2.1's Import Tiddlers also calls addTiddler, which doesn't trigger ZW's save
  machinery.

Release 2.1.2.1
* Move status variables from ziddly to a tiddler ZiddlyStatus
* Move ajax.js and ziddly.js into tiddler ZiddlyWikiPlugin
* Enable Markup* tiddlers
* Move RSS into MarkupPostBody
* Combine common tiddlers (like the above) from ZiddlyWiki/tiddlers with site
  tiddlers.
* Fix setting title

Release 2.0.11.3
* handle config.protectedTiddlers better -- explicitly add the 'protected'
  when these shadow tiddlers are displayed.
* Adjust editing logic
* Don't unlock when not editing (e.g. viewing a read only tiddler)
* Make cancelling the edit of a non-existing (i.e. shadow) tiddler work

Release 2.0.11.2
* Set revisionKey on get and save (prevents ZiddlyWiki from reloading the
  tiddler you just edited).
* Perform a redirect on save so that the user gets the revisionKey for the
  newly modified tiddler.
* Remove editing locks if no changes are made.
* Check to see if a WebDAV lock is held on tiddlers before editing.
* Editing a tiddler that exists on the server but not in your browser will
  fetch the text from the server, rather than editing an empty tiddler.
* Editing a tiddler that exists on the server but is deleted will display a
  message, and edit the text that is on the server.  Cancelling the edit will
  leave it deleted.
* Unset store.dirty after a tiddler is successfully saved, so the "Unsaved
  Changes" dialog isn't shown when the user leaves.  This still needs some work
  -- it's still possible that the wiki in your browser was at some time unable
  to save to the server but the "Unsaved Changes" dialog won't appear.

Release 2.0.11.1
* If chkHttpReadOnly, do not attempt to unlock tiddlers on 'view'
* Fix escaping to match the core.  (WRT HTML entities &quot;, &lt;,
  &gt;, &amp;, <, >)  WARNING -- this will require you to convert your
  tiddlers in Zope.  A new script is provided for this:
  ZiddlyWiki/upgrade.  Copy it to the location of your 'tiddlers' folder
  and run it like http://your.site/TiddlySite/upgrade.  Do this only
  ONCE for each tiddlywiki site you're running, then delete the upgrade
  script.
* When a tiddler tagged with 'private' is saved, the Zope permissions
  will be set to make it not accessable through
  http://your.site/TiddlySite/tiddlers/<private tiddler> The above
  upgrade script will also add these permissions to any existing private
  tiddlers.

			<p>Welcome to the world's shared business entity data. Over the course of the past few years, Avox has processed hundreds of thousands of business entity data records for numerous global clients. On this website, you will find basic information about a number of those business entities including their legal name, country of incorporation, primary operational location details which comprise country, state/province/region of incorporation (for US, Canadian and Australian entities) and city as well as the Avox identifier (we refer to it as the AVID).</p>
			<p>We are putting these "skinny" records on this website for restriction free usage. The only thing we ask in return is for you to inform us when you find something that you believe is incorrect. For example, you may not be able to locate a business with a specific name in the country where we indicated it operates or is registered. We will work with you to establish the correct information. By doing so, you will help improve and maintain the quality and timeliness of this shared data asset making it more reliable and therefore more useful for everyone (by the way, the most frequent cause of incorrect data is because the entity has gone through a name or address change). It may also be that you have the incorrect information from a source that you have assumed was always correct in the past.</p>
			<p>Note that there may be minor discrepancies resulting from application of acronyms or punctuation which you don't need to tell us about unless these discrepancies don't comply with our data standards. A short explanation of those standards is shown when you hover your cursor over the heading of each column in the search results.</p>
			<p>Avox is publishing this information for your free usage in an effort to help facilitate a common standard for business entity data. By making this content available for free, we are making this everyone's data. The AVID can also be used freely. Any data record with an AVID attached has been comprehensively verified and is maintained by our team of data experts. It is also continuously checked by our clients by virtue of its usage within their organizations. And now, it's also being checked by you.</p>
			<p>Of course, as a commercial enterprise, we have a mandate to generate profitable revenue. By publishing this basic data, we therefore hope to generate interest in additional data and services offered by Avox. Users of the wiki-data directory can subscribe to a file download of the content displayed on wiki-data. a daily data update notification service, <a href="http://www.avox.info/pdfs/wikidata_field_specs.pdf" target="_new">additional data fields</a> or our <a href="http://www.avox.info/loading.shtml">standard data maintenance service</a> which includes access to complete audit trails of data sources used for verification. You can also view a <a href="http://www.avox.info/pdfs/wikidata_sample_record.pdf" target="_new">sample record</a> of the full set of field data.</p>
			<p>The next step for wiki-data is to extend the management of this data into the hands of the community. This will enable you to add more records, more attributes, comments, audit histories, the lot. As a data service provider, we have limited resources and capabilities to maintain millions more data records for free. As a community however, we jointly have almost unlimited resources which can be harnessed for the purpose.</p>
			<p>"Aren't you undermining your own business by doing this?" you may ask. On the contrary, by acting as a catalyst to drive an open standard for this data, we believe that we will increase demand for authoritative verification and enrichment services provided by firms such as Avox. Not everyone will choose to work with us but that's not the point. We expect that wiki-data will help other vendors provide better quality data in a more efficient manner which ultimately helps you, the user of this data. We all win. The key to our future success at Avox will be to continuously innovate and provide additional content, links and services. Some of this will be funded by clients directly. Some of our offerings will be funded by advertising. And some we will provide for free in the spirit of wiki-data and because delivering more value to the global community increases awareness of our brand and the success of our business.</p>
			<p>We've set up a blogging forum for WikiData at <a href="http://avoxinfo.blogspot.com/">http://avoxinfo.blogspot.com/</a> where we hope you will offer your ideas, comments and criticisms. This is the beginning of an open standard in business entity data. It needs your active participation. We welcome and encourage involvement from other vendors regardless of whether or not they are our competitors.</p>
			<p>By leveraging the internet, open standards and a global community it is our strong belief that costs can be driven down substantially while data quality will elevate to the highest possible level. So let's get started. As we like to say at Avox, "It's your data".</p>

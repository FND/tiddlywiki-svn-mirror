"""
A plugin that remedies an URI encoding problem
encountered when running TiddlyWeb under Apache.
The plugin reverts the path in the PATH_INFO variable 
to its undecoded form.

The problem being addressed occurs with URIs containing
%2F characters (encoded forward slashes). 

Currently Apache supplies the PATH_INFO variable in decoded form. 
As a result, all instances of %2F in the URI are replaced 
with a / character in PATH_INFO. The Selector is then 
thrown off since it depends on forward slashes to match 
handlers. No match, and the requested PUT, GET, DELETE, 
etc., operation goes unhandled.

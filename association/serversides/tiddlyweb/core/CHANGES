    BeautifulSoup tree).

0.9.8 Thu Jan 22 17:07:34 GMT 2009

  * Make sure that we enforce the use of an older BeautifulSoup
    to avoid errors while parsing TiddlyWiki files
  * urllib.quote escapes () but javascript encodeURIComponent does
    not, leading to Etag comparison errors. Fixed.
  * If the tiddlyweb.usersign is GUEST accept modifier value
    in PUT Tiddlers.
  * Add some code that shows how to use mod_wsgi to mount TiddlyWeb.

0.9.3 Wed Dec  3 20:05:03 GMT 2008

  * Increase the granularity of modified timestamps on

    some (but not all) caching problems.

0.9.2 Tue Dec  2 19:56:53 GMT 2008

title: URLs

The TiddlyWeb system is based around what should be clean and meaningful URLs. You can find a map of those URLs in UrlMap. The URLs point to the resources that are made available by the system. Every working URL in TiddlyWeb is, with specific ntent, a noun. If an action is performed on that noun it is through the HTTP method being called on the URL. Some examples:

{{{GET /recipes}}} Get a list of recipes
{{{GET /recipes/TiddlyWeb/tiddlers}}} Get a list of the tiddlers in the TiddlyWeb recipe
{{{PUT /bags/NewContent/tiddlers/MyNewTiddler}}} Put a tiddler named MyNewTiddler in the NewContent bag

The web is the nouns, HTTP is the verbs.

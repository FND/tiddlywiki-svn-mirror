title: Bag

A bag is a container of [[Tiddler]]s with a [[Policy]] that constrains the actions that can be performed on that bag: read, write, create and delete tiddlers.

A bag may also have a description field, containing text that may describe the purpose of the bag or the meaning of the tiddlers contained within.

The combination of a bag's name and a tiddler's name is the unique name of a [[Tiddler]].

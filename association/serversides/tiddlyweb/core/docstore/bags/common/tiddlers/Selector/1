title: Selector

Selector is a [[Python]] tool that does URL to code dispatching (or delegation) for [[WSGI]] applications.

It allows delegation through configuration.

TiddlyWeb uses Selector to control what URLs are made available. The UrlMap lists the default URLs but this list can be extended in plugins.

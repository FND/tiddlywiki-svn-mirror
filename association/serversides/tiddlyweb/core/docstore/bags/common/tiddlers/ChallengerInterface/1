title: ChallengerInterface

TiddlyWeb [[Challenger]]s must support the simple ChallengerInterface. The interface is described in the [[tiddlyweb.web.challengers package|http://svn.tiddlywiki.org/Trunk/association/serversides/tiddlyweb/core/tiddlyweb/web/challengers/__init__.py]].

The interface is deliberately constrained to a GET request and POST, so that challengers implementors are thinking in terms of the web. The OpenID challenger demonstrates how this simple interface can achieve a fair amount of complex behavior.

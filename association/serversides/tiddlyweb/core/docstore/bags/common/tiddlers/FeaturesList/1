Type the text for 'FeaturesList'At base TiddlyWeb is a [[Python]] [[WSGI]] application. It makes use of a variety of Python and WSGI features to be flexible and useful. A basic TiddlyWeb installation provides:

* A modular/pluggable datastore for storing [[Tiddler]]s in [[Bag]]s and building [[Recipe]]s.
* An HTTP API to accessing that datastore (see [[URLs]] and [[WebHandlers]]).
* Server side rendering of wikitext to HTML, for online viewing.
* A command line tool (called [[twanager]]) for controlling multiple installations on a single server.
* An extensible authentication system based on [[Challenger]]s and [[CredentialsExtractor]s. See also UsersAndSecurity.
* A straightforward authorization system using [[Policy]] statements associated with [[Bag]]s and [[Recipe]]s.
* Python based configuration system.
* FilterStrings
* A simple plugin system for adding features.
* Rudimentary support for storing and delivery binary content (such as images).
* Unicode on the inside, UTF-8 on the outside.
* Ships with its own server (cherrypy's wsgiserver) but also works with CGI, mod_python, mod_wsgi, etc.

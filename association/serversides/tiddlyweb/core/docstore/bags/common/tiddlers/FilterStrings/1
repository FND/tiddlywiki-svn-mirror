title: FilterStrings

A [[Recipe]] is made of a list of a [[Bag]]s modified by strings representing filters. The list of bags is processed to create a workspace (a collection of tiddlers). The filters are used to select or remove one or more tiddlers based on name or tag from the building list of tiddlers.

Here's the code: http://trac.tiddlywiki.org/browser/Trunk/contributors/ChrisDent/experimental/TiddlyWeb/tiddlyweb/filter.py

In TiddlyWeb you can experiment with filters directly from the URL line:

[[click this example|http://peermore.com:8080/bags/TiddlyWeb/tiddlers?%5Btag%5BsystemConfig%5D%5D]] (tiddlers in the bag TiddlyWeb tagged systemConfig)

[[or this one|http://peermore.com:8080/bags/TiddlyWeb/tiddlers?%5Bcount%5B5%5D%5D]] (5 tiddlers from the bag, unknown sort)

[[or recent changes|http://peermore.com:8080/bags/TiddlyWeb/tiddlers?%5Bsort%5B-modified%5D%5D%20%5Bcount%5B5%5D%5D]] (top five of the all the tiddlers sorted by descending modified time)


The syntax used is the same as the syntax used in filterTiddlers in the client.

If you add some content with various tags the power of this will become more clear.

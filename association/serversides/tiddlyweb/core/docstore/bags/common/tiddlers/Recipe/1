title: Recipe

A recipe is an ordered list of [[Bag]]s and FilterStrings that result to a list of tiddlers.

They are used to create [[TiddlyWiki]]s with a set of plugins and content customized for a particular use case.

If a recipe results in more than one instance of a Tiddler with the same name, the Tiddler from the recent [[Bag]] is the one used.

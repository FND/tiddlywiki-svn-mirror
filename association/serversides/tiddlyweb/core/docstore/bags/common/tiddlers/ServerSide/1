title: ServerSide


In the TiddlyWiki context, a ServerSide is a web-server-based application that provides remote storage for [[Tiddlers]], making them accessible from a variety of locations, a variety of platforms and by a variety of people.

Storing Tiddlers on a server can help a team collaborate, provide a convenient backup, and allow a TiddlyWiki user to share their content with others.

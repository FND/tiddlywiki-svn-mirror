This site is up temporarily so people can experiment with a pre-alpha TiddlyWeb. Feel free to create and change content.

You have a few options:
* You can use the page directly from http://peermore.com:8080/recipes/TiddlyWeb.wiki and click sync to save your changes whenever you like.
* You can save the page to disk as a usual TiddlyWiki file, and sync from there.
* You can browse the the URLs presented by tiddlyweb itself. A starting point is http://peermore.com:8080. You can add .txt, .json and .wiki to many of the URLs to get different representations. Not all URLs support all extensions. Not all things which respond to .wiki will produce a workspace that will synchronize properly.
* When browsing bags you can play with FilterStrings

Only content which you create from existing tiddlers will be synchronized. A new tiddler will not.

If you choose to add plugins, realize that you may blow things up for other people.

Contact cdent@peermore.com or send mail to the TiddlyWikiDev group if there are issues.

It is ''very'' likely there will be problems, especially with concurrent writes to the datastore.

does it work?

Closet is a Python [[WSGI]] web service written by ChrisDent that operates as a write only data store for things that need to be accessed over the web. Any sorts of things. It's stored at google code: http://code.google.com/p/openclimber/source/browse/closet/trunk

Some of the ideas in Closet have been carried over to TiddlyWeb.

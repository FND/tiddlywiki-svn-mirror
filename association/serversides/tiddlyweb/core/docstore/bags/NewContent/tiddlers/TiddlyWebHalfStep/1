Any information in this wiki that is marked with TiddlyWebHalfStep is subject to change as the API and implementation of TiddlyWeb changes. A half step is exploratory work in a particular direction to see if that direction is the right one. As development and documentation move at different speeds there is a significant chance the documentation will be out of date relative to the codebase.

When the codebase stabilizes for version 1.0 this will no longer be an issue. TiddlyWeb remains some distance from version 1.0.

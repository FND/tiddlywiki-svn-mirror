A Store is the TiddlyWeb name for a system that does persistent storage of [[Recipe]], [[Bag]], [[Tiddler]], and [[User]] objects. A TiddlyWeb installation may use (under normal circumstances) only one store, but what that store is up to the configuration of the installation.

By default TiddlyWeb uses a simple text files in a hierarchy of directories store. All of the activity of the store is located in one module, {{{tiddlyweb.stores.text}}}, which implements the StorageInterface.

Other stores can be created by creating a class called Store that implements the StorageInterface. A sample can be found in the code distribution in {{{googleappengine/googledata.py}}}.

A critical aspect of using the Store in TiddlyWeb is that the non store code must ''never'' use methods on the store that are not part of the StorageInterface.

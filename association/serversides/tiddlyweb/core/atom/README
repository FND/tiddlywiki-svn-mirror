The module in this directory, atom.py, demonstrates a way
to do a very simple Atom format syndication of a recipe, bag
or single tiddler (including filter strings). It is an
external serialization. If you look at atom_server.py in the
root of the TiddlyWeb distribution you will see that the config
dictionary is imported and then extended to add the information
necessary for a \.atom extension to request application/atom+xml
data via an atom.atom serialization.

Any module which supports the SerializationInterface defined in
tiddlyweb/serializations/__init__.py can be associated with any
content type in the config dictionary. It is even possible to
override the default serializers.

The same is true for stores. See the googleappengine for more
information on that.

The Atom code is borrowed from Django's django/utils/feedgenerator.py

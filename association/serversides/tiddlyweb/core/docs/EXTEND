TiddlyWeb has been built from the outset to be easy to extend on
many dimensions. The methods range from fairly structured to very
flexible.

** Challengers

** Serializers
** Web Handlers 
** twanager commands

** Default tiddlywiki source HTML file
** URL prefix to the API's URLs
** What server is used to run things

* Ways extensions are managed

** plugins (system and manager)
*** add or modify config and code
** server startup scripts (which change config or modify code)

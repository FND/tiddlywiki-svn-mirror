If you have installed TiddlyWeb's requirements (see README)
it is possible to run a test server from a code checkout,
to give it a try and make sure your system is working. See
docs/COOKBOOK for more detailed instruction on what to do
when TiddlyWeb has been installed as a Python package.

From the checked out directory run:

  python demo.py

Point your browser at 

  http://0.0.0.0:8080/recipes/TiddlyWeb/tiddlers.wiki

and get a TiddlyWiki with content stored in this code
checkout.

You can do other exploring by pointing your browser at

  http://0.0.0.0:8080/

Any changes you make to existing tiddlers, or tiddlers
that you create by linking from existing tiddlers,
will be saved to the server when you click the sync link
in the TiddlyWiki.

If you point your browser at

  http://0.0.0.0:8080/recipes/AutoTiddlyWeb/tiddlers.wiki

changes will be automatically saved to the server after
clicking 'done' when editing a Tiddler.

Hitting ctrl-C will stop the server (after a few seconds).

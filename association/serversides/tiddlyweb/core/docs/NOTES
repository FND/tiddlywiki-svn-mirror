== URLS ==

See urls.map in tiddlyweb/urls.map for the map that

code to handle those requests.

== STORAGE ==

Storage is handled by "Stores", which implement a 
StorageInterface for getting and putting recipes, bags,
tiddlers and (optionally) users, and for listing
collections of same.

A text store has been implemented in tiddlyweb/stores/text.py.
The interface is described in tiddlyweb/stores/__init__.py.

A store that uses google's appenging data store can be found
at
http://svn.tiddlywiki.org/Trunk/contributors/ChrisDent/experimental/tiddlyweb-plugins/googleappengine/

A store may optionally support tiddler revisions, wherein revisions
are indicated by an integer, each new revision has a revision of
the last revision id + 1. If a store does not support revisions
the tiddler is always at revision 1.

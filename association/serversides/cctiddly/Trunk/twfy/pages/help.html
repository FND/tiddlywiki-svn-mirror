This interface was built by <a href='http://simonmcmanus.com'>Simon McManus</a> using <a href='http://jquery.com/'>jQuery</a>.

All the data is taken from <a href='http://theyworkforyou.com/'>theyworkforyou.com </a>.  The API is used for postcode lookup but the data is mainly collected using screenscraping.  </br>

This is not an attempt to advocate screenscraping, its a technique full of problems. I built this site to help me learn jQuery.

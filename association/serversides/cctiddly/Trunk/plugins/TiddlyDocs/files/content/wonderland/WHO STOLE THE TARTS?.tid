In the very middle of the court<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it. &quot;I wish they'd get the trial done,&quot; Alice thought, &quot;and hand 'round the refreshments!&quot;</p> <p class="figright"><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19033/19033-h/images/i019.jpg"><img src="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19033/19033-h/images/i019_th.jpg" alt="Illo19" /></a></p> <p>The judge, by the way, was the King and he wore his crown over his great wig. &quot;That's the jury-box,&quot; thought Alice; &quot;and those twelve creatures (some were animals and some were birds) I suppose they are the jurors.&quot;</p> <p>Just then the White Rabbit cried out &quot;Silence in the court!&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Herald, read the accusation!&quot; said the King.</p> <p>On this, the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, then unrolled the parchment-scroll and read as follows:</p> <div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">&quot;The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,<br /></span> <span class="i2">All on a summer day;<br /></span> <span class="i0">The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts<br /></span> <span class="i2">And took them quite away!&quot;<br /></span></div></div> <p>&quot;Call the first witness,&quot; said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and called out, &quot;First witness!&quot;</p> <p>The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread and butter in the other.</p> <p>&quot;You ought to have finished,&quot; said the King. &quot;When did you begin?&quot;</p> <p>The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the court, arm in arm with the Dormouse. &quot;Fourteenth of March, I <i>think</i> it was,&quot; he said.</p> <p>&quot;Give your evidence,&quot; said the King, &quot;and don't be nervous, or I'll have you executed on the spot.&quot;</p> <p>This did not seem to encourage the witness at all; he kept shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and, in his confusion, he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread and butter.</p> <p>Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation&mdash;she was beginning to grow larger again.</p> <p>The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread and butter and went down on one knee. &quot;I'm a poor man, Your Majesty,&quot; he began.</p> <p>&quot;You're a <i>very</i> poor <i>speaker</i>,&quot; said the King.</p> <p>&quot;You may go,&quot; said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court.</p> <p>&quot;Call the next witness!&quot; said the King.</p> <p>The next witness was the Duchess's cook. She carried the pepper-box in her hand and the people near the door began sneezing all at once.</p> <p>&quot;Give your evidence,&quot; said the King.</p> <p>&quot;Sha'n't,&quot; said the cook.</p> <p>The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said, in a low voice, &quot;Your Majesty must cross-examine <i>this</i> witness.&quot;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p> <p>&quot;Well, if I must, I must,&quot; the King said. &quot;What are tarts made of?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Pepper, mostly,&quot; said the cook.</p> <p>For some minutes the whole court was in confusion and by the time they had settled down again, the cook had disappeared.</p> <p>&quot;Never mind!&quot; said the King, &quot;call the next witness.&quot;</p> <p>Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list. Imagine her surprise when he read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the name &quot;Alice!&quot;</p></html>

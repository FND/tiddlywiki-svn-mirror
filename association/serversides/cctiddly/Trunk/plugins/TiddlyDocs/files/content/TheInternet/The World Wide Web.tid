<html><p>Many people use the terms <i>Internet</i> and <i>World Wide Web</i> (or just the <i>Web</i>) interchangeably, but, as discussed above, the two terms are not <a class="mw-redirect" title="Synonymous" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synonymous">synonymous</a>.</p> <p>The World Wide Web is a huge set of interlinked <a class="mw-redirect" title="Documents" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documents">documents</a>, <a title="Computer graphics" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics">images</a> and other resources, linked by <a title="Hyperlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink">hyperlinks</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" title="URLs" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URLs">URLs</a>. These hyperlinks and URLs allow the <a class="mw-redirect" title="Web servers" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_servers">web servers</a> and other machines that store originals, and cached copies of, these resources to deliver them as required using <a class="mw-redirect" title="HTTP" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP">HTTP</a> (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). HTTP is only one of the communication protocols used on the Internet.</p> <p><a title="Web service" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service">Web services</a> also use HTTP to allow software systems to communicate in order to share and exchange business logic and data.</p> <p>Software products that can access the resources of the Web are correctly termed <i><a title="User agent" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent">user agents</a></i>. In normal use, <a class="mw-redirect" title="Web browsers" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browsers">web browsers</a>, such as <a title="Internet Explorer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer">Internet Explorer</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" title="Firefox" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox">Firefox</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" title="Apple Safari" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Safari">Apple Safari</a>, access web pages and allow users to navigate from one to another via hyperlinks. Web documents may contain almost any combination of <a class="mw-redirect" title="Computer data" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_data">computer data</a> including graphics, sounds, <a title="Plain text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text">text</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" title="Web video" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_video">video</a>, <a title="Multimedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia">multimedia</a> and interactive content including <a class="mw-redirect" title="Web game" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_game">games</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" title="Office applications" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_applications">office applications</a> and scientific demonstrations.</p> <p>Through <a class="mw-redirect" title="Keyword (Internet search)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyword_%28Internet_search%29">keyword</a>-driven <a title="Internet research" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_research">Internet research</a> using <a title="Web search engine" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_search_engine">search engines</a> like <a title="Yahoo! Search" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo%21_Search">Yahoo!</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" title="Google (search engine)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_%28search_engine%29">Google</a>, millions of people worldwide have easy, instant access to a vast and diverse amount of online information. Compared to <a title="Encyclopedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopedia">encyclopedias</a> and traditional <a class="mw-redirect" title="Libraries" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libraries">libraries</a>, the World Wide Web has enabled a sudden and extreme decentralization of information and data.</p> <p>Using the Web, it is also easier than ever before for individuals and organisations to <a class="mw-redirect" title="Publish" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish">publish</a> ideas and information to an extremely large <a title="Audience" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audience">audience</a>. Anyone can find ways to publish a web page, a <a title="Blog" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog">blog</a> or build a website for very little initial <a title="Cost" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost">cost</a>. Publishing and maintaining large, professional websites full of attractive, diverse and up-to-date information is still a difficult and expensive proposition, however.</p> <p>Many individuals and some companies and groups use &quot;web logs&quot; or <a title="Blog" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog">blogs</a>, which are largely used as easily updatable online diaries. Some commercial organisations encourage <a class="mw-redirect" title="Employees" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employees">staff</a> to fill them with advice on their areas of specialization in the hope that visitors will be impressed by the expert knowledge and free information, and be attracted to the corporation as a result. One example of this practice is <a title="Microsoft" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft">Microsoft</a>, whose <a title="Software developer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_developer">product developers</a> publish their personal blogs in order to pique the public's interest in their work.</p> <p>Collections of personal web pages published by large service providers remain popular, and have become increasingly sophisticated. Whereas operations such as <a title="Angelfire" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelfire">Angelfire</a> and <a title="GeoCities" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities">GeoCities</a> have existed since the early days of the Web, newer offerings from, for example, <a title="Facebook" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook">Facebook</a> and <a title="MySpace" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySpace">MySpace</a> currently have large followings. These operations often brand themselves as <a title="Social network service" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network_service">social network services</a> rather than simply as web page hosts.</p> <p><a title="Online advertising" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising">Advertising</a> on popular web pages can be lucrative, and <a class="mw-redirect" title="E-commerce" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce">e-commerce</a> or the sale of products and services directly via the Web continues to grow.</p> <p>In the early days, web pages were usually created as sets of complete and isolated <a title="HTML" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> text files stored on a web server. More recently, websites are more often created using <a title="Content management" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management">content management</a> or <a title="Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki">wiki</a> software with, initially, very little content. Contributors to these systems, who may be paid staff, members of a club or other organisation or members of the public, fill underlying databases with content using editing pages designed for that purpose, while casual visitors view and read this content in its final HTML form. There may or may not be editorial, approval and security systems built into the process of taking newly entered content and making it available to the target visitors.</p></html>

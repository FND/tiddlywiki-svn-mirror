<html><p>The Internet has made possible entirely new forms of social interaction, activities and organizing, thanks to its basic features such as widespread usability and access.</p> <p><a title="Social network service" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network_service">Social networking</a> websites such as <a title="Facebook" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook">Facebook</a> and <a title="MySpace" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySpace">MySpace</a> have created a new form of socialization and interaction. Users of these sites are able to add a wide variety of items to their personal pages, to indicate common interests, and to connect with others. It is also possible to find a large circle of existing acquaintances, especially if a site allows users to utilize their real names, and to allow communication among large existing groups of people.</p> <p>Sites like <a title="Meetup.com" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meetup.com">meetup.com</a> exist to allow wider announcement of groups which may exist mainly for face-to-face meetings, but which may have a variety of minor interactions over their group's site at meetup.org, or other similar sites.</p></html>

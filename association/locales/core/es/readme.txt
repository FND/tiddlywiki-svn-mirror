Spanish translation for TiddlyWiki
----------------------------------

This is a new version of the Spanish translation for TiddlyWiki in support of 
TW version 2.4.0. and up.
This translation plugin is based on v0.3.6 from Sergio González and Pedro 
Domínguez which was published earlier, but was not UTF-8 and all diacrytical 
characters were incorrect.
Most corrections were made by Dave Gifford; many thanks Dave!

Complete ready to use empty Spanish TiddlyWikis v2.4.1 and v2.4.3 are provided
as well as the language-plugin on its own.

So you can either download "locale.es.js" and apply it to your own TW as a 
systemConfig-tagged tiddler or download "TW243emptyES.html", and create/import 
your own tiddlers in that empty Spanish TW.


Your feedback is very much welcomed at "tonsweb (at) xs4all (dot) nl".

P.S. and Acknowledgements:
It was by no means my intention to take over from Sergio González and/or
Pedro Domínguez, but their website couldn't be reached, and the language-file
on SVN was incorrect. I needed a valid Spanish translation and found one with
the help of Dave Gifford. Since I consider the Spanish language a very important
world-language I decided, in consultancy with Martin Budden, to publish this
version. So all credits for this translation are still for Sergio González and
Pedro Domínguez (and some for Dave Gifford for his contributions/corrections).

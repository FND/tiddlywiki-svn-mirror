Dutch translation for TiddlyWiki
--------------------------------

This is the new release of the Dutch translation for TiddlyWiki in support of TW version 2.4.0. and up.
My translation plugin is self-contained, so no extra tiddlers needed.

A complete ready to use Dutch empty TiddlyWiki v2.4.0 is provided too.

So you can either download "locale.nl.js" and apply it to your own TW as a systemConfig-tagged tiddler
or download "TW224emptyNL.html" and create/import your own tiddlers in that empty Dutch TW.

Your feedback is very much welcomed at "tonsweb (at) xs4all (dot) nl".

Dutch translation for TiddlyWiki
--------------------------------

This is the new release of the Dutch translation for TiddlyWiki in support of
TW version 2.4.0. and up.
My translation plugin is self-contained, so no extra tiddlers needed.

Complete ready to use Dutch empty TiddlyWikis v2.4.0, v2.4.1 and v2.4.3 are provided
as well as the translation plugin on it's own (locale.nl.js).

So you can either download "locale.nl.js" and apply it to your own TW as a
systemConfig-tagged tiddler
or download "TW243emptyNL.html", and create/import your own tiddlers in that empty Dutch TW.

Your feedback is very much welcomed at "tonsweb (at) xs4all (dot) nl".

P.S. "locale025.nl.js" is the language file for previous versions of TiddlyWiki,
     from TW v2.2.0 up until TW v2.3.0

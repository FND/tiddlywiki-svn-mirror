Dutch translation for TiddlyWiki
--------------------------------

This is the initial release of the Dutch translation for TW's as of version 2.2.0.
My translation plugin is self-contained, so no extra tiddlers needed.

A ready to use Dutch empty TW v2.2.4 is provided too.

Your feedback is very much welcomed at "tonsweb (at) xs4all (dot) nl".

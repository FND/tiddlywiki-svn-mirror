Translators and commentators sometimes make it sound as if Machiavelli were talking about something altogether different than the tradition, as if this were just an instance in which one word was being used for entirely different ideas.  But then Machiavelli's philosophical point would be lost.  Machiavelli is taking the traditional concept of virtue as natural human excellence, with all its teleological baggage, and giving it a partially new content.  Excellence for a ruler is not the same thing as excellence for a citizen, and excellence for a ruler involves a willingness to engage in what would otherwise be immoral, unjust conduct, and which still may tarnish the ruler's immortal soul, even if it is necessary in the situation for the safety / glory of the patria.  It is not the case that all virtues (= excellences) go together and imply one another, as Socrates optimistically believed.  New conception of an old concept, not just homonyms.

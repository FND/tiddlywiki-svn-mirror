Welcome to your personal POLS 250 notebook. Each time you open it, your notebook will sync automatically with the course wiki, downloading the lecture outlines I post before class. You can't modify my pages, but you can add your own notes them by clicking the "edit notes" button. Your notebook can be your own integrated, searchable, indexed, and cross-referenced repository for course content - one that is available even if you are not connected to the internet.

Now for a few important technical details:
* //Security Warnings:// When you first try to save your notebook, you will get a security warning; click "yes" or "accept" to allow your browser to save changes to your hard drive.
* //Entering vs. Saving:// After entering notes, you need to save your notebook, by clicking the big "save notebook" button on the left hand side of the page. If you don't, and you try to close your browser or navigate away, you will get a warning about unsaved changes. Get in the habit of clicking "save notebook" regularly.
* //Logging In:// When you first opened your notebook, you were prompted to log in, so that the notebook could download pages from the course wiki. If you typed the wrong username or password, you won't be able to download anything. In that case, just click "save notebook" (to catch any notes you've entered), then close and reopen the notebook and try again.</pre>

<pre>You can save changes with any version of FireFox, and also many other browsers in the FireFox family, such as Camino on the Mac and MiniMo on mobile devices. The procedure is:
# Click the button labelled 'save changes' over in the right hand sidebar
# If prompted with an "Internet Security" dialog as follows, click the checkbox labelled "Remember this decision" and then the "Allow" button
## "A script from "file://" is requesting enhanced capabilities that are UNSAFE and could be used to compromise your machine or data..."
# You should then see a message at the top right of the window saying "Main TiddlyWiki file saved"
If you accidentally //deny// permission instead, you may need to UnravelFireFoxPermissions.</pre>

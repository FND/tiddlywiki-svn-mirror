<pre>Wikispaces offline is based on the hugely popular TiddlyWiki product; an entire wiki product packaged into a single html file! TiddlyWiki is free, open source, and already has a loyal community of developers and enthusiasts helping to develop it and support new users. There are over 400+ plugins which can be used to configure ~TiddlyWiki in a multitude of ways. It can be used as a task management tool, a de-centralised collaboration tool, a platform for writing and de-bugging software, simply for organising notes or in many other ways.

The entire TiddlyWiki is made up of microcontent called tiddlers, including all the content and the code required to make it function. You're reading a tiddler right now - try double clicking on this text to send it into edit mode. If you have a working knowledge of javascript or css, you can immediately get under the hood, configuring it in any way you like! If you have questions, the TiddlyWiki community is incredibly helpful - there's a [[developer's group|http://groups.google.com/group/TiddlyWikiDev]] and a [[user's group|http://groups.google.com/group/TiddlyWiki]] on Google Groups.

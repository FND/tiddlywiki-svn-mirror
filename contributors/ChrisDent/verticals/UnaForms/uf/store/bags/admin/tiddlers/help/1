This is a rudimentary help document for [[Former]].

The system provides two basic pieces of functionality:

# It lets an administrator create a PackageTemplate: the source of a TiddlyWiki which is then used for editing forms (a Package?).
# It lets a form user (someone who fills in forms) retrieve a Package of their choice and save filled (partial and complete) forms back to the server


!!Administration

In TiddlyWeb terms, a PackageTemplate is a Recipe: the tiddlers from one or more Bags. Every package has two of the same bags

# system: The TiddlyWeb client plugins are kept
# formcore: The default tiddlers required for basic form functionality

and is customized by the content in a package specific bag. This bag contains:

# content and style for customizing the look and feel of the package
# View and Edit templates specific to the form or forms in the system.

Therefore it is the responsibility of the administrator or an administrative tool to:

# create the package specific bag, including the required custom content
# create the package template recipe, associating the system and formcore bags with the package specfic bag
# (maybe: associate a unique identifier with the recipe, identifying a URL for a particular for user)

A TiddlyWiki plugin that provides a URI based library
for accessing a TiddlyWeb server. Designed to be used
by other plugins that would like to perform some accessing
of TiddlyWeb.

The rationale for such at thing is that at certain points
in a wiki's interaction with a TiddlyWeb, the goal is
to browse and potentially select resources that exist in
the TiddlyWeb server and _not_ simply GET and PUT tiddlers.

This plugin provides the tools that allow such browsing 
but provides no specific interface for the browsing.

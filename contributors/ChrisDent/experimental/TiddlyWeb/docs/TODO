A place to note tasks that need to be done. This is not complete, and likely not up to date.

If you think there should be something on this list, contact ChrisDent.

!Functionality

!! Middleware and Starters

* Remove logger from the index.cgi app configuration and make sure errors get sent to stderr.
* Set REMOTE_USER in the real (os) environment so Apache can use that if we are in Apache and want its logging.

!! Core

* Explore storage of binary content types in the system. Perhaps Base64 encoded tiddler bodies.

!! Serializations

* Support for skinny tiddlers and lazy loading.

!! Stores

* Implement support for deleting users from the store.
* Additional stores: S3, sqlite, subversion, etc.

!! Filters

* Unify filter string syntax on Jon's research.
* Add name fragments to arguments in filters

!! Web Handling

* There are unicode issues in the GAE handling of html content. (via bentrem)
* User registration concerns.

!! Miscellaneous

* py2app and py2exe versions for one click installation on OS X and Windows.
* Maybe use mimeparse for accept and content-type header handling: http://code.google.com/p/mimeparse/

!Tests and assurancs

* Tests for '..', '/', etc in title and name fields w/ store handling. !!
* Rhino and Selenium based testing.

!Cleanliness, Documentation and Protocol Behavior

* Proper navigability between resources in HTML and JSON reps.
* More readable, and more, HTTP based tests, demonstrating, clearly, the protocol.
* As a sample use case, create a blog recipe in which blog content is writeable by the author, but not by others, and there is a CommentPlugin for others to leave feedback.

!Client side issues and plugins

* Fix a bug in TiddlyWebAutoSavePlugin where it says there's been a successful save even when the server is no longer running. Should be an error.
* There needs to be a way in the client to do a refresh when a 412 comes along.
* Bag security policy authoring
* Client side recipe and bag construction sets.

!Moonbeams from Ponies of the Future

* Align with http://www.mnot.net/blog/2008/03/20/beyond_methods

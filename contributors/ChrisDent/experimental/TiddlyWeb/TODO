A place to note tasks that need to be done. 
This is not complete, and likely not up to date.

* Tests for '..', '/', etc in title and name fields w/ store handling.
* Adjust TiddlyWebAdaptorPlugin so it is Etag aware (browser should take care of this for us?)
* Change Tiddly core so server.bag is an inherited field?
* In SyncMachine pay attention to response codes from the web server in onGetTiddlerList and onPutTiddler, handle appropriately
* DELETEing resources besides tiddlers.
* Client side recipe and bag construction sets.
* PUT a full wiki to a recipe name and have it decomposed (as in import)
* align with http://www.mnot.net/blog/2008/03/20/beyond_methods
* add name fragments to arguments in filters
* Authentication (basic and OpenID)
** credentials extraction for getting/validating the user (started)
** challenging for getting a user into the system (started)
* Bag security policy authoring
* S3 store
* sqlite store
* Proper navigability between resources in HTML and JSON reps.
* Recipes that contain bags on multiple servers.
* More readable, and more, HTTP based tests, demonstrating, clearly, the protocol.
* Rhino and Selenium based testing.
* As a sample use case, create a blog recipe in which blog content is writeable by the author, but not by others, and there is a CommentPlugin for others to leave feedback.
* Create a thing like /importer that has the test/importer.py sort of doing its thing.
* Modification times and other metadata and header handling for bag and recipe entities.

A place to note tasks that need to be done. 
This is not complete, and likely not up to date.

= Release 1 =

* Tests for '..', '/', etc in title and name fields w/ store handling.

* Choose encoding for '/'.

* Flesh out tiddler object's handling of created field.

* confirm unicode/UTF-8 testing and handling etc

* PUT text reps of things, with robustness
** Deal with non-existent bags or no bag in URL
** Handle updating existing tiddler appropriately

* HTTP cache headers production
** expiration stuff
** last modified time (based on grazing all the tiddlers?)

= After Release 1 =

* DELETEing tiddlers and other resources.

* Client side recipe and bag construction sets.

* Turn serializers and stores into classes, so instances
  can carry some configuration data (like the path of the store)

* Do file locking in text store.

* PUT a full wiki to a recipe name and have it decomposed (as in import)

* align with http://www.mnot.net/blog/2008/03/20/beyond_methods

* add name fragments to arguments in filters

* Tiddler revisions

* Incoming HTTP cache headers handling

* Authentication (basic and OpenID)
** credentials extraction for getting/validating the user
** challenging for getting a user into the system

* Authori[zs]ation (bag security policy handling and authoring)

* store and serializer pluggability

* S3 store

* sqlite store

* Atom and/or RSS representation of lists of tiddlers

* Proper navigability between resources in HTML and JSON reps.

* Recipes that contain bags on multiple servers.

* More readable, and more, HTTP based tests, demonstrating, clearly,
  the protocol.

* Rhino and Selenium based testing.

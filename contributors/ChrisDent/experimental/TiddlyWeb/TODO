A place to note tasks that need to be done. This is not complete, and likely not up to date.

If you think there should be something on this list, contact ChrisDent.

!Functionality

* Support merging config data from a file to overload tiddlyweb.config.
* Support for skinny tiddlers and lazy loading.
* Move filter query string processing into middleware that is up a stage, so it can be in the environment and used throughout the application (e.g the html serialzation can know if a filter string is present when it makes * URLs). This fixes the "these tiddlers as a wiki" links.
* Change outgoing wiki serialization so that it handles a few template variables for things like <title>, prehead, posthead, etc. (see: http://groups.google.com/group/TiddlyWikiDev/msg/4a3505c17caa81f4)
* There are unicode issues in the GAE handling of html content. (via bentrem)
* Unify filter string syntax on Jon's research.
* DELETEing resources besides tiddlers.
* add name fragments to arguments in filters
* Authentication
** Policy decisions/flowchart of authentication handling.
** User registration concerns.
** Client interaction with challengers (surviving redirects).
* Additional stores
** S3 store
** sqlite store
** subversion store
* Modification times and other metadata and header handling for bag and recipe entities.
* py2app and py2exe versions for one click installation on OS X and Windows.

!Tests and assurancs

* Tests for '..', '/', etc in title and name fields w/ store handling.
* Rhino and Selenium based testing.
* Do some testing and fixing to enable Unicode Tiddler titles.

!Cleanliness, Documentation and Protocol Behavior

* Proper navigability between resources in HTML and JSON reps.
* More readable, and more, HTTP based tests, demonstrating, clearly, the protocol.
* As a sample use case, create a blog recipe in which blog content is writeable by the author, but not by others, and there is a CommentPlugin for others to leave feedback.

!Client side issues and plugins

* Fix a bug in TiddlyWebAutoSavePlugin where it says there's been a successful save even when the server is no longer running. Should be an error.
* Bag security policy authoring
* Client side recipe and bag construction sets.
* Adjust TiddlyWebAdaptorPlugin so it is Etag aware (browser should take care of this for us?)
* Change Tiddly core so server.bag is an inherited field?
* In SyncMachine pay attention to response codes from the web server in onGetTiddlerList and onPutTiddler, handle appropriately
* Create a command line tool for creating bags and recipes on remote servers.

!Moonbeams from Ponies of the Future

* Align with http://www.mnot.net/blog/2008/03/20/beyond_methods
* Recipes that contain bags on multiple servers.

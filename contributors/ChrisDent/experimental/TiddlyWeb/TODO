A place to note tasks that need to be done. This is not complete, and likely not up to date.

If you think there should be something on this list, contact ChrisDent.

!Functionality

* /search that leads search_tiddlers on the store
** could be just a pass
** search_tiddlers gets a free string, returns a list of Tiddlers, which the handler is required to filter for permissions.
*** how the searching is done is up to the store and invisible to the rest of the system
** create a tiddler_written() hook location in the store, for overrides
* Adjust filter_string handling in queries so that it is a named argument, not just the straight QUERY_STRING.
* DELETEing resources besides tiddlers.
* PUT a full wiki to a recipe or bag name and have it decomposed (as in import)
* add name fragments to arguments in filters
* Authentication
** Policy decisions/flowchart of authentication handling.
** credentials extraction for getting/validating the user (started)
** challenging for getting a user into the system (started)
** OpenID handling
* Additional stores
** S3 store
** sqlite store
** subversion store
* Create a thing like /importer that has the test/importer.py sort of doing its thing.
* Modification times and other metadata and header handling for bag and recipe entities.

!Tests and assurancs

* Tests for '..', '/', etc in title and name fields w/ store handling.
* Rhino and Selenium based testing.

!Cleanliness, Documentation and Protocol Behavior

* Proper navigability between resources in HTML and JSON reps.
* More readable, and more, HTTP based tests, demonstrating, clearly, the protocol.
* As a sample use case, create a blog recipe in which blog content is writeable by the author, but not by others, and there is a CommentPlugin for others to leave feedback.

!Client side issues and plugins

* Bag security policy authoring
* Client side recipe and bag construction sets.
* Adjust TiddlyWebAdaptorPlugin so it is Etag aware (browser should take care of this for us?)
* Change Tiddly core so server.bag is an inherited field?
* In SyncMachine pay attention to response codes from the web server in onGetTiddlerList and onPutTiddler, handle appropriately

!Moonbeams from Ponies of the Future

* Align with http://www.mnot.net/blog/2008/03/20/beyond_methods
* Recipes that contain bags on multiple servers.

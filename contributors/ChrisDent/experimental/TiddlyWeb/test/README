These tests may be run with py.test[1]. From the TiddlyWeb base
directory simply type py.test and the tests will be found and
run.

Tests which test the web serving sides of the application 
require httplib2[2] and wsgi_intercept[3] (so no web server 
is required). These tests run alongside the other tests 
without any special setup required.

[1] py.test is part of py lib and can be found at

TiddlyWeb, aka mo'ass, is a reference implementation of an ideal
server side implementation for TiddlyWiki. It provides a tested,
documented, and clear implementation of several facets that make
up a good server side:

* transparent system and code suitable for porting to other
  languages (where use specific optimzations will hopefully occur)
* an abstract model for authentication and authorization
* an implementation of workspaces, recipes and bags as described
  elsewhere
* clean REST-style web-based and -friendly API
* test driven description and development

This system is not designed to be highly performant nor scalable
in its first several iterations.

REQUIREMENTS:

* Python 2.4 or 2.5
* selector: http://lukearno.com/projects/selector/
* simplejson: http://undefined.org/python/#simplejson

Both selector and simplejson can be installed with easy_install.

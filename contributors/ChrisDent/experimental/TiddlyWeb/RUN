TiddlyWeb is sufficiently mature to be run and messed with
from a code checkout. Meaning you can give it a try if you like.

= Requirements =

* Python 2.4 or 2.5.
* selector and simplejson must be installed where python
  can find them (see the README file).

Run 

  python demo.py

Point your browser at 

  http://0.0.0.0:8080/recipes/TiddlyWeb.wiki

and get a TiddlyWiki with content stored in this code
checkout.

You can do other exploring by pointing your browser at

  http://0.0.0.0:8080/

Any changes you make to existing tiddlers, or tiddlers
than you create by linking from existing tiddlers,
will be saved to the server when you click sync.

= Advanced Experimentation =

There are as yet no client side tools for creating
recipes and bags. The TiddlyWebAdaptorPlugin can
synchronize tiddler content in the workspace generated
from a recipe, but it cannot create a recipe.

If you want to create a recipe, you can do so by 
hand. If you investigate the files in the store
directory, the structure of existing recipe files
and bag directories can be duplicated to create
new ones. A recipe must consist of at least one
bag. If there is at least one tiddler in the bag,
it is possible to download a workspace from

   http://<host>:<port>/recipes/<recipe name>.wiki

New content created as links from the one tiddler
in the bag can be synched to the server.

Another option is to import an existing TiddlyWiki
file into the datastore. Look at, and adapt

  test/importer.py

accordingly.

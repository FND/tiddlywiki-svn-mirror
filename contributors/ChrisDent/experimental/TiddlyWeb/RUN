TiddlyWeb is sufficiently mature to be run and messed with
from a code checkout. Meaning you can give it a try if you like.

= Requirements =

* Python 2.4 or 2.5.
* selector and simplejson must be installed where python
  can find them (see the README file).

Run 

  python demo.py

Point your browser at 

  http://0.0.0.0:8080/recipes/TiddlyWeb/tiddlers.wiki

and get a TiddlyWiki with content stored in this code
checkout.

You can do other exploring by pointing your browser at

  http://0.0.0.0:8080/

Any changes you make to existing tiddlers, or tiddlers
that you create by linking from existing tiddlers,
will be saved to the server when you click sync.

If you point your browser at

  http://0.0.0.0:8080/recipes/AutoTiddlyWeb/tiddlers.wiki

changes will be automatically saved to the server after
clicking 'done' when editing a Tiddler.

with your own content.

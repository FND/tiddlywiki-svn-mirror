== STORAGE ==

Storage is handled by "Stores", which implement an interface 
for getting and putting recipes, bags and tiddlers. A text
store has been implemented in tiddlyweb/stores/text.py.
The interface is described in tiddlyweb/stores/__init__.py.

A store that uses google's appenging data store can be found
in googleappengine/googledata.py.

A store may optionally support revisions, wherein revisions
are indicated by an integer, each new revision has a revision of
the last revision id + 1. If a store does not support revisions
the tiddler is always at revision 1.

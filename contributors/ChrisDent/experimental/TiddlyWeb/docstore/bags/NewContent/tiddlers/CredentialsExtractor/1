A CredentialsExtractor examines an incoming request to see if it contains sufficient information to extract a username and validate that it is authentic. If it is the username is injected into the WSGI environment as {{{tiddlyweb.usersign}}}. If no username is available usersign is set to GUEST.

TiddlyWeb can be configured (via {{{tiddlyweb.config.extractors}}}) to use an ordered stack of extractors. When one returns a value the stack is left and {{{tiddlyweb.usersign}} set. If no value is returned from one extractor the next is tried.

Credentials are installed in requests by successfully interacting with a [[Challenger]].

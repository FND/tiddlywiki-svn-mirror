A Challenger is an interface for requesting and processing information from a web-based user to authenticate a potential user of the TiddlyWeb system. Once a user is authenticated, [[CredentialsExtractor]]s in future requests will make the user's id available to authorization systems.

The challenger system is extensible by creating new classes that implement the simple ChallengerInterface. At this time there are three challengers:

* cookie_form: A simple username and password form that validates the username and password against the UserDatabase.
* openid: A bare bones implementation of version 1 of OpenID.
* google_user_challenger: For use with GoogleAppEngine: authenticate a google user against the google user database.

A TiddlyWeb installation can be configured to present one or more challengers using the {{{tiddlyweb.config.auth_systems}}} key on tiddlyweb.config.

TiddlyWeb is written using version 2.5 of [[Python]].

Its basic architecture is strongly based on [[Joe Gregorio]]'s [[Robaccia]] toy framework, meaning: TiddlyWeb is a [[WSGI]] application that uses [[Selector]] to dispatch a small number of URLs to simple functions in simple modules that satisfy the request.

The TiddlyWeb UrlMap maps URLs to code.

There are three primary entities operating in the TiddlyWeb system:

* [[Recipe]]s
* [[Bag]]s
* [[Tiddler]]s

These are represented in code by '''very''' simple classes. Recipe, Bag and Tiddler objects have no methods, only attributes. Other modules use the objects in concert with other modules to perform required actions. These other modules can be divided into sets:

* WebHandlers
* [[Store]]s
* [[Serializer]]s
* [[Control]]
* [[Filter]]s
* [[WSGI Middleware]]

The UrlMap dispatches requests to WebHandlers. The WebHandlers instantiate Recipe, Bag and Tiddler objects and then get them from or put them to [[Store]]s. When the request requires some form of output, a [[Serializer]] is used to transform the object to the required form. A bastardized form of [Content Negotiation] is done to select which Serializer to use.

More to come.

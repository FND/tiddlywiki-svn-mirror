TiddlyWeb is a ServerSide tool for use with TiddlyWiki.

See [[the TiddlyWikiDev announcement|http://groups.google.com/group/TiddlyWikiDev/browse_thread/thread/f075630bd1e5564e]]

It is designed:
* to provide flexible but (eventually) secure access to groups of [[Tiddlers]] stored on one or more web servers
* to adhere as much as possible to HTTP standards and best practices
* to make few assumptions about how content will be managed, thus enabling unexpected client applications
* to (eventually) provide a readable codebase that acts as a reference implementation for many server side implementations
* to have a useful set of tests

These documents are in progress. They live in the eternal hope of someday achieving perfection.

At the moment, they demonstrate that TiddlyWeb is working: This information is being written in a TiddlyWiki produced from TiddlyWeb and managed by the TiddlyWebAdaptorPlugin.

ChrisDent took the first stab at TiddlyWeb with lots of input from JeremyRuston and the gang at [[Osmosoft]].

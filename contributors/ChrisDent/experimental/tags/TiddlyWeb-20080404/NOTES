Storage is handled by "Stores", which implement an interface 
for getting and putting recipes, bags and tiddlers. A text
store has been implemented in tiddlyweb/stores/text.py.

Other stores to come.

We've not yet had any serious discussion about revision handling.

  a real TiddlyWiki, or instrument a realy TiddlyWiki.

  needs work.

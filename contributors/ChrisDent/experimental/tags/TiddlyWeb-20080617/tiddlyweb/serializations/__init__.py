    A Serialization is a collection of methods that 
    either turn an input string into the object named
    by the method, or turn the object into a string
    form.

    The interface is fairly simple: For the data 
    entities that exist in the TiddlyWeb system there
    (optionally) exists <entity>_as and as_<entity> methods
    in each Serialization.
    
    *_as returns a string form of the entity, perhaps as
    HTML, Text, YAML, Atom, whatever the Serialzation does.

    as_* takes a provided entity and string and updates
    the skeletal entity to represent the information
    contain in the string (in the Serialization format).

    There are also two supporting methods, list_recipes()
    and list_bags() that provide convince methods for
    presenting a collection of either in the Serialization
    form. A string is returned.

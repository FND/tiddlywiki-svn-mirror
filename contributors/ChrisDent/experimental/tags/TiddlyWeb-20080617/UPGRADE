If you have been using TiddlyWeb prior to there being support
for revisions, you can update your text store with a simple script,
assuming you have a bourne style shell.

Each bag lives in bags directory:

   store/bags/<bag_name>

Each of those directories contains a tiddler directory:

  store/bags/<bag_name>/tiddlers

cd into each <bag_name>/tiddlers directory and run this:

  for i in * ; do echo $i; mv "$i" tmp; mkdir "$i"; mv tmp "$i/1";done

Obviously more of this could be automated. Contributions welcome.

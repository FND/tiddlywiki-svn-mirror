tiddlywebweb is a version of TiddlyWeb that uses TiddlyWeb
as its datastore. It is being created for several reasons:

* To demonstrate the extensibility and flexibility of the TiddlyWeb
  system. Including "code A does not need to be near code B".
* To stimulate the creation a python-based client side library for
  accessing TiddlyWeb.
* To prove (as in test) the system.
* To enable a platform for performance testing.
* To confirm HTTP cache header handling.
* To do the luscious CSci wankery of self-hosting.

The primary change is the creation of a StorageInterface that 
uses httplib2 to talk to a different tiddlyweb server, sending 
and receiving JSON.

What we should end up with are:

tiddlywebweb/tiddlywebstore.py: implements StorageInterface
manager:                        user to start server
tiddlywebconfig.py:             sets configuration items

Likely issues include:

* No access to users in the URI space.
* Struggles with managing challengers and credentials mgt. In fact
  how does this work at alL?
* Does TiddlyWeb cache well enough?
* Are the JSON repressentations robust enough?

tiddlywebweb is a plugin for TiddlyWeb that allows the use
of a different TiddlyWeb instance as its datastore.

It has been created for several reasons:

* To demonstrate the extensibility and flexibility of the TiddlyWeb
  system. Including "code A does not need to be near code B".
* To stimulate the creation a python-based client side library for
  accessing TiddlyWeb.
* To prove (as in test) the system.
* To enable a platform for performance testing.
* To confirm HTTP cache header handling.
* To do the luscious CSci wankery of self-hosting.

The primary change is the creation of a StorageInterface that 
uses httplib2 to talk to a different tiddlyweb server, sending 
and receiving JSON.

What we should end up with are:

tiddlywebweb/tiddlywebstore.py: implements StorageInterface
tiddlywebconfig.py: required configuration directives

Look at test_me() in tiddlywebweb/tiddlywebstore.py for some
sample test code that goes through the motions of retrieving
content from http://tiddlyweb.peermore.com/, the TiddlyWeb
home site.

Likely issues include:

* Authentication and Authorization completely left out for now.
* Does TiddlyWeb cache well enough?

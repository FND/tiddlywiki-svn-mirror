This plugin shows a way to add an editor link to any server
side page that is displaying an individual tiddler as HTML.

It overrides tiddlyweb.web.wsgi.HTMLPresent.footer_extra
to add the link, and adds a WSGI app at /formedtor.

Formeditor is just a simple texteditor that allows you to
change the text of a tiddler.

Not that at the moment you can only have one plugin that
overrides edit_link. Otherwise you get some recursion problems.
Workin on fixing it.

A collection of plugins and etc for making a web site that
is based on TiddlyWeb. Things to consider:

* a home page
* a tool for making your own TiddlyWeb served TiddlyWiki
  that has particular editing capabilities (see spowt)
* a documentation engine which presents tiddlers faqas (answers)
* an admin interface that allows one to see what's on the 
  server and do some useful stuff

So that leads us to think we've got some things:

* homer.py
* spowt2.py
* faqtwer.py
* admin.py

We'll want jinga nearby to make this happen.

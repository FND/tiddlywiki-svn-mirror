It is possible to run TiddlyWeb on Google's AppEngine service, 
with some work.

*** Familiarity with AppEngine is required for any of this to 
*** make sense. This development was done using the OS X
*** GoogleAppEngineLauncher.

The basic requirement is to create a Store that uses the google
appengine data system. Once that is made it is just a matter of
gathering up the necessary required modules in an appengine 
directory and then deploying to the service.

The store is included in the directory with this README: googledata.py.

For the sake of simplicity tiddlers revisions and bag policies are
not supported. Neither are required for TiddlyWeb to operate (as
long as you don't request a revisions URL). Very simple db.Model
classes that mirror Recipe, Tiddler and Bag are used for storage. 

main.py is the script which appengine uses to get things going.
Because TiddlyWeb is a pure WSGI application with no framework 
requirements, there's not a lot that happens here. A significant
difference from the default server run is that the SimpleLog
WSGI app is not included in the stack. Appengine does its own 
logging.

The AppEngine SDK should create app.yaml and index.yaml files
for you in a directory. The penultimate step is gathering the necessary
libraries and files into that directory. This can be done by symlink 
or copy. Don't forget the External requirements. Don't use eggs. 

Here's a list of external requirements:

* selector.py
* resolver.py
* simplejson
* If you want server side wikitext to html rendering:
** wikklytext 
** ply

Here's an edited listing of my test directory:

app.yaml
index.yaml
ply
resolver.py
selector.py

simplejson -> ../src/python/simplejson-1.9.2/build/lib/simplejson
wikklytext -> /Library/Python/2.5/site-packages/WikklyText-1.2.2-py2.5.egg/wikklytext

atom -> ../src/osmo/TiddlyWeb/atom
lib -> ../src/osmo/tiddlywiki/contributors/ChrisDent/experimental/TiddlyWeb/lib

googledata.py -> ../src/osmo/TiddlyWeb/googleappengine/googledata.py
google_user_challenger.py -> ../src/osmo/TiddlyWeb/googleappengine/google_user_challenger.py
google_user_extractor.py -> ../src/osmo/TiddlyWeb/googleappengine/google_user_extractor.py
main.py -> ../src/osmo/TiddlyWeb/googleappengine/main.py
tiddlywebconfig.py -> ../src/osmo/TiddlyWeb/googleappengine/tiddlywebconfig.py

tiddlyweb -> ../src/osmo/TiddlyWeb/tiddlyweb
urls.map -> ../src/osmo/TiddlyWeb/urls.map

When you have the directory set up in a reasonable fashion,
edit main.py such that the host and port information
contained therein is appropriate for your use.

You will need to put something in your TiddlyWeb to be able
to use it. There are a few different ways to do this. 

* Check out test/importer.py to see how to either:
** import an existing TiddlyWiki file
** code samples on how to PUT recipes, bags and tiddlers

* See tiddlywebweb, an experimental library for accessing
  TiddlyWeb (and to be used as a tiddlyweb store) in 
  http://svn.tiddlywiki.org/Trunk/contributors/ChrisDent/experimental/tiddlywebweb/
  to create bags, recipes and tiddlers.

* Write your own HTTP code to PUT bags, recipes and tiddlers to the 
  server.

If you want to be able to sync or autosave you will need
these plugins, which can be found in 
http://svn.tiddlywiki.org/Trunk/contributors/ChrisDent/experimental/TiddlyWeb/lib

* TiddlyWebAdaptorPlugin
* TiddlyWebAutoSavePlugin

TiddlyWikiDev google group.

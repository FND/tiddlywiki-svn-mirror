This plugin shows a way to add an editor link to any server
side page that is displaying an individual tiddler as HTML.

It overrides tiddlyweb.web.wsgi.HTMLPresent.footer_extra
to add the link, and adds a WSGI app at /tiddlyeditor.

For that editor to work the system needs to know about 
some tiddlers that it will use to create the TiddlyWiki
that does the editing. These go into tiddlywebconfig.py
in the 'tiddlyeditor_tiddlers' slot. See the tiddlywebconfig.py
in this directory.

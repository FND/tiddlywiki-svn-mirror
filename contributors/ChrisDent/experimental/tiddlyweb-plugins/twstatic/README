static.py is a simple plugin to deliver static content read from disk
via the tiddlyweb code. This is only useful if you are using the 
cherrypy webserver that ships with TiddlyWeb. If you are not, for 
example if you are using Apache, then have that web server deliver 
static content. It will be much more efficient.

See the code for installation and configuration information.

This is an experiment with creating a TiddlySpot style
thing using TiddlyWeb. What's here thus far is just
game playing to flesh out some of the ideas.

The name comes from thinking about Spot, TW, Spout,
and a few other things all at the same time.

You need jinja2 (a templating engine) to make this go.
Get information about it at http://jinja.pocoo.org/2/

This is being developed outside the TiddlyWeb source
tree to see what needs to happen to make tiddlyweb
work well as a library. For current work some symlinks
needs to be made (choose the right paths for your 
situation):

lrwxr-xr-x  1 cdent  cdent  21 Oct 10 18:59 ./cherrypy -> ../TiddlyWeb/cherrypy
lrwxr-xr-x  1 cdent  cdent  16 Oct 10 18:38 ./lib -> ../TiddlyWeb/lib
lrwxr-xr-x  1 cdent  cdent  22 Oct 10 18:38 ./tiddlyweb -> ../TiddlyWeb/tiddlyweb
lrwxr-xr-x  1 cdent  cdent  21 Oct 10 18:39 ./urls.map -> ../TiddlyWeb/urls.map
lrwxr-xr-x  1 cdent  cdent  21 Oct 10 18:39 ./manager -> ../TiddlyWeb/manager

You will need to create a tiddlyweb bag (alternatively
if you understand make, have a look at the Makefile in
the same directory as this README):

    ./manager bag tiddlyweb
    ^D

And then add the required plugins to that bag. You can
use the from-svn plugin:

    ./manager from_svn tiddlyweb \
        http://svn.tiddlywiki.org/Trunk/verticals/tiddlywebclient/plugins/TiddlyWebAdaptorPlugin.js
        http://svn.tiddlywiki.org/Trunk/verticals/tiddlywebclient/plugins/TiddlyWebAutoSavePlugin.js
        http://svn.tiddlywiki.org/Trunk/verticals/tiddlywebclient/plugins/TiddlyWebSpowtDefaulterPlugin.js

Then if you run 

    ./manager server 0.0.0.0 8080

You can go to http://0.0.0.0:8080/spowt and do some
stuff.

The assocation between Recipe name and user is maintained
in the note field of the User database. A hack, but
working for the time being.

These dependencies work for Python 2.5

For 2.4 we also need:

* wsgiref (available with easy_install)
* elementree (usually available in the package system)

To use these, symlink this directory into your TiddlyWeb
checkout, and add the following line near the top of manager:

  sys.path.append('tiddlywebdependencies')

(This is just a first stab, an improved version to come,
once things are fleshed out.)

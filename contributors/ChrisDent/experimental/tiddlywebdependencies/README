This is a tool to create an archive of all the necessary
dependencies for TiddlyWeb.

Once the archive is created it is uploaded to some 
accessible location. From there people can download
it. They can then unpack it and add the location to
their PYTHONPATH either with PYTHONPATH or

    sys.path.insert(0, <the path>)

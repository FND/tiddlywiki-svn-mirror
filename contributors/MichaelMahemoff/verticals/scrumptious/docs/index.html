    <p>Hello. This is Scrumptious, a <a href="http://tiddlyweb.peermore.com">TiddlyWeb</a> powered system for nested commenting on websites, similar in some respects to <a href="http://delicious.com">Delicious</a> and <a href="http://digg.com">Digg</a>. The biggest difference is that it's open source, so you can use it freely. Install it on your company intranet to host private conversations, for example.</p>
    <p><strong>Note: <em>Scrumptious is currently in comedy-alpha stage. It's not ready for production use.</em></strong></p>

    <h2>Examples Of Use</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Private conversations around public and private content.</strong> Joe is a knowledge manager at Megacorp Ltd, a global manufacturer. As Joe is there to help staff co-ordinate and share ideas with each other, he sets up Scrumptious on Megacorp's intranet. Employees can now have private conversations about any website, both public and private (intranet-based).</li>
    <li><strong>Public conversation around public content.</strong> Sue is CEO of Video Monitor Ltd, a small media monitoring organisation. She sets up Scrumptious so staff can identify videos where their client has been mentioned, and have a conversation about how they will report it back to the client. Aiming for an open conversation, she configures the URLs and comments to be publicly available, but editable only by her staff.</li>
    <li><strong>Private conversations around public content.</strong> Larry, Curly, and Moe live in different cities and are planning a trip together. They set up Scrumptious to track hotels and events, and have a private conversation to decide which they will ultimately book.</li>
    <li><strong>Public conversations around public content</strong> Bob is a blogger who has created his own blogging framework, but does not want to implement a comments system. Using a simple script tag, he integrates Scrumptious into his blog to provide the typical feature of public comments about a particular article.</li>
    <li><strong>Many more examples ....</strong> If you take the perspective that "everything is a URL", Scrumptious makes it easy to have a conversation about anything and everything, because you're simply having conversations around different URLs. Based on the flexible TiddlyWeb framework, configuration is possible too - so it's relatively easy to make things public, private, or read-only; and, there is flexibility around things like authentication mechanisms and back-end storage systems.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Who Made This?</h2>

  <p>Scrumptious was built by <a href="http://softwareas.com">Michael Mahemoff</a> at <a href="http://osmosoft.com">Osmosoft</a> and is released under <a href="LICENSE">a BSD license</a>. There are <a href="INSTALL">installation instructons here</a> and in the tarball.</p>

  <h2>Why Did We Make It?</h2>

    <p>We want Scrumptious to be a practical system for organsations to talk about the web and share its content - private content as well as public.</p>
    
    <p>Scrumptious also serves to demonstrate these principles central to Osmosoft's mission:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The URL is the Thing.</strong> The key organising principle for Scrumptious is the URL; each URL has its own unique set of comments. As long as your app has a unique URL for each distinct "thing" (i.e. "resource", such as a user, a book, or an event), you can use this tool to let people comment about that thing.</li>
      <li><strong>Server-client separation.</strong> TiddlyWeb offers a RESTful data access mechanism. Initial clients have been all been powered by the TiddlyWiki client, and Scrumptious is the first demo of a practical web app that is <em>not</em> TiddlyWiki based; it is simply a generic web app powered by JQuery, making XMLHttpRequest calls to the TiddlyWeb server.</li>
      <li><strong>Open Source.</strong> We want Scrumptious to be as useful and robust as possible, and an open source model is the best way to gather feedback and contributions from the outside world. We will be building Scrumptious flexibly so that others can use it to "scratch their own itch".</li>
  </ul>

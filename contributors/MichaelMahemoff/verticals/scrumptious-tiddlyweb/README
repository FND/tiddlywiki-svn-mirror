This is the original version of scrumptious, designed to run as a pure TiddlyWeb app, with pure HTML served from TiddlyWeb.

The newer Scrumptious is in the verticals/scrumptious directory and runs inside of a TiddlyWiki, with a view to plugging into TiddlyHoster for multi-user application.

Dependencies:
tiddlyweb

Welcome to the Playground! A little tool by [[Michael Mahemoff|http://mahemoff.com]] to stick a bunch of small web apps into a single TiddlyWiki, which is to say, a single file. You can then mail the file to your mates, who can make further changes if they like, or upload it to a server to share the demos with the world. Because it's a TiddlyWiki, there are hundreds of plugins available to drop into your Playground to make it look and feel just the way you like it.

Welcome to the Open Source Portal, a place for open source related policy, reporting, and discussion.

The scope covers a range of open source usages - developers introducing open source components and frameworks to their code base, developers releasing their products as open source, and all users installing open source products on their desktop.

The portal:
* Provides information about open source in general; and our corporate guidelines surrounding their usage.
* Promotes community discussions around these concepts.
* Acts as a data repository for information about our projects and their open source usage.
* Based on the data provided, offers advice and alerts about following policy and licensing requirements.

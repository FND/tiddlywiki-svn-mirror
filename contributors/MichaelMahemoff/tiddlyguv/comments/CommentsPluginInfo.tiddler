<pre>This is a comments macro. Usage:
&lt;&lt;comments&gt;&gt;

Posting it in its current form following interest at yesterday's show and tell. No options or anything or even a proper header right now. Sorry. Most of it was coded inside tiddlywiki, prior to learning cook. Now that I can edit normally, I'll do some refactoring right away, then blog it and note it on the google group.</pre>

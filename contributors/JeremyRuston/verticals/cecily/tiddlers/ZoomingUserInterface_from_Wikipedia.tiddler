<p>In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing" title="Computing" target="_blank">computing</a>, a <b>Zooming User Interface</b> or <b>Zoomable User Interface</b> (<b>ZUI</b>, pronounced Zoo-ee) is a graphical environment where users can change the scale of the viewed area in to see more detail or less. A ZUI is a type of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface" title="Graphical user interface" target="_blank">graphical user interface</a> (GUI). Information elements appear directly on an infinite <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_desktop" title="Virtual desktop" target="_blank">virtual desktop</a> (usually created using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics" title="Vector graphics" target="_blank">vector graphics</a>), instead of in windows. Users can pan across the virtual surface in two dimensions and zoom into objects of interest. For example, as you zoom into a text object it may be represented as a small dot, then a thumbnail of a page of text, then a full-sized page and finally a magnified view of the page.</p> 
<p>Some experts consider the ZUI interface paradigm as a flexible and realistic successor to the traditional windowing GUI. But little effort is currently spent developing ZUIs, while there are ongoing efforts for developing GUIs.</p>

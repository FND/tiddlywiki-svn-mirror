<pre>The [[Principles]] guiding the development of ProjectCecily are based on some underlying beliefs:
* Humans are better at manipulating two dimensional environments than three dimensional; we evolved on the savannah and we're best at thinking in the two-and-a-bit dimensions to be found there
* Maps are an effective metaphor for communicating and organising information about a two dimensional space</pre>

<pre>[[Principles]] guiding the development of ProjectCecily:
* Tiddlers are boxes of text laid out on an infinite two dimensional canvas 
* Tiddlers can be moved and resized arbitrarily
* FractalBackgrounds can be used to give subtle location and scale cues

Some of these [[Principles]] are derived from some more fundamental [[Beliefs]]</pre>

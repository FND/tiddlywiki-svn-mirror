<pre>Jeremy is the only real constant in Osmosoft, the company he set up in 2005, that BT acquired this May. 

After a career creating inspiring software, Jeremy is now BT's Head of Open Source Innovation. This roughly means that he is responsible for the development of BT's participation in the open source industry. He also looks pretty funky in aviators. 

If you're popping in to the office, Jeremy will have a cappuccino and a pain au chocolat.

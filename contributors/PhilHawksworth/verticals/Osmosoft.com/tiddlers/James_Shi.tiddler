<pre>James has been involved in a variety of web related roles for the past ten years, and shows his age and geekiness by always bringing up how he was paid to play one of the first MMORPG while in high school.

These days, James is involved in finding ways for people and organizations to use technology to collaborate.

If you're popping in to the office, James will have a cup of English Breakfast tea with milk, and some grapes.

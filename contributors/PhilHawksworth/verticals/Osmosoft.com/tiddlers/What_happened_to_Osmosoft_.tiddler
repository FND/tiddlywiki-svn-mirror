<pre>Jeremy announced the acquisition of Osmosoft by BT on the 29th May in [[this blog post|http://jermolene.wordpress.com/2007/05/29/i-for-one-welcome-my-new-bt-overlords]]. 

[[TiddlyWiki|http://tiddlywiki.com]] has been moved under the auspices of the [[UnaMesa|http://www.unamesa.org]] foundation, an open, not-for-profit organisation. It's still free and it's still open source and so shall it remain.</pre>

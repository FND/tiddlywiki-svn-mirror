<pre>Creating a task is easy. Any tiddler that you tag with the word 'task' will become a task tiddler. When you exit edit mode of a task tiddler, you will see that it is presented as a task and has controls on it to allow you to set some of your [[pre-defined|TaskDefinitions]] values on it.

Alternatively, you can create a new task by clicking the <<newTiddler label:'new task' title:NewTask tag:task text:'Type some text and then press DONE to view the task controls'>> button in the control bar towards the top of the screen.</pre>

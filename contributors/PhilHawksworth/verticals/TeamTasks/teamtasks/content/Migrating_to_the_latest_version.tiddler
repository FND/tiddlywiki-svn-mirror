Since TeamTasks is built using TiddlyWiki, it contains all of the application logic, the styling, the content, and all of your tasks in a single file. This means that upgrading your instance of TeamTasks might seem like a fiddly task. Don't panic. It's simple when you know how!
	
!Downloading an empty copy of the latest ~TeamTasks version and then importing your tasks and views.
The process of upgrading a TiddlyWiki is well documented at [[www.tiddlywiki.com/#HowToUpgrade|http://www.tiddlywiki.com/#HowToUpgrade]]. Refer to that documentation to help you upgrade, but rather then downloading a fresh version of Tiddlywiki as your starting point, you should download a fresh version of TeamTasks by right-clicking on [[this link|http://www.hawksworx.com/playground/TeamTasks/index.html]], selecting 'Save target' or 'Save link' and saving it in a convenient location. You can then import your tasks into that file.
	
!Perhaps you would prefer to import the updated and new plugins into your existing ~TeamTasks file.
If this is the case, you should refer to the [[HowToUpgrade|www.tiddlywiki.com/#HowToUpgrade]] documentation as above, but rather than importing your tasks and views into a fresh teamTasks file, you should import into your exisiting TeamTasks file. You will need to import the following tiddlers from http://www.hawksworx.com/playground/TeamTasks in order to upgrade to version 0.4 of TeamTasks:
*[[FullScreenPlugin|http://www.hawksworx.com/playground/TeamTasks/#FullScreenPlugin]]
*[[NewUserWizardPlugin|http://www.hawksworx.com/playground/TeamTasks/#NewUserWizardPlugin]]
*[[TableSortingPlugin|http://www.hawksworx.com/playground/TeamTasks/#TableSortingPlugin]]
*[[TaggedTemplateTweak|http://www.hawksworx.com/playground/TeamTasks/#TaggedTemplateTweak]]
*[[TTReportViewPlugin|http://www.hawksworx.com/playground/TeamTasks/#TTReportViewPlugin]]
*[[TTMigrateTasks0304Plugin|http://www.hawksworx.com/playground/TeamTasks/#TTMigrateTasks0304Plugin]]
*[[ValueSwitcherPlugin|http://www.hawksworx.com/playground/TeamTasks/#ValueSwitcherPlugin]]

!Incompatible task tiddlers.
Version 0.4 employs a slightly different format for storing information on the task tiddlers to previous versions. A macro to upgrade all of your task tiddlers to adopt this new format is available in this plugin: [[TTMigrateTasks0304Plugin|http://www.hawksworx.com/playground/TeamTasks/#TTMigrateTasks0304Plugin]]

!!!Using the macro.
Using the macro is simple. 
#Import the [[TTMigrateTasks0304Plugin|http://www.hawksworx.com/playground/TeamTasks/#TTMigrateTasks0304Plugin]] as described above.
#Save your file and reload it to make sure that the macro is available to run.
#Create a new tiddler in your document and edit it to include a call to the migration macro like this {{{<<TTMigrateTasks0304>>}}}
#Click {{{done}}} to finish editing your new tiddler. The macro will run, converting all of your existing tasks to the latest version.
#Save your TeamTasks document in the usual way.
#Reload and if you wish, delete the TTMigrateTasks0304Plugin tiddler and the new tiddler you created to run the macro - you won't need them again.

<pre>My thanks go out to all of the people who kindly send feedback about TeamTasks in the hope that it will improve.

If you have any comments or suggestions, or if you would like to report a bug, you can email me at ''ph [at] osmosoft [dot] com'' or place a comment in the Tiddlywiki development group at http://groups.google.com/group/TiddlyWikiDev/

I do listen to all the feedback and have tried to log here the planned development work to address your comments.

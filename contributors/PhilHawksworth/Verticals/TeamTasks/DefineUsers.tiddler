<pre>In TeamTasks, you can assign tasks to users. If you are using TeamTasks individually and don't need to have different users set up, you can easily [[remove this functionality]] to make things appear even simpler in the user interface.

Defining a user is really simple. All you need to do is add user's names to the UserDefinitions tiddler.  Each name should occupy a single line in the tiddler.  All of the names in the UserDefinitions tiddler will be available for you to assign a task to.

TeamTasks also makes things simple for you if you need a slightly more complex setup.  Consider a situation where you have many users, each with a tiddler which describes their contact details and has a default set of [[TaskListViews|TaskListView]] for the user to gain easy access to their tasks.  TeamTasks has a [[wizard to help you create these users|UserSetupWizard]].  You can even [[configure the wizard|UsersInformationStructure]] so that asks for the information about the users that you want to record in TeamTasks.</pre>

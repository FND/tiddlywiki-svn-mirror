<pre>Osmosoft.com is a single TiddlyWiki file, which means you can download the whole thing in one go and change it as much as you like. Right-click [[this link|http://www.osmosoft.com/index.html]] and select &quot;save link as...&quot; or &quot;save target as...&quot; to download a copy.

We'd love to see your ideas for how we can improve Osmosoft.com and if you want to take a copy and change it, even better. TiddlyWiki has a [[thriving community|http://www.tiddlywiki.com/#Community%20HelloThere%20Release2.2%20GettingStarted%20MainFeatures%20Feedback]] of developers who can help you get started if you've never worked with a TiddlyWiki before.

Please see the [[Get involved]] tiddler for more information.</pre>

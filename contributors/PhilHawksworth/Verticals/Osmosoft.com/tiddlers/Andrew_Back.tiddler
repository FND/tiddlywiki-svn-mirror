<pre>As a teenager, while his friends played with games consoles, Andrew got his kicks from a salvaged [[PDP-11 minicomputer|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_Data_Processor]]. He has an unhealthy obsession with devices, operating systems and computer networks, and was introduced to open source via Linux back in 1995.

At BT, Andrew has been responsible for setting up Design's Open Source Focus Group, and he is a strong advocate of open computing platforms.

If you're popping in to the office, Andrew will have a cup of tea with milk and sugar and a chocolate brownie.

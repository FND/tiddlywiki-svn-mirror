<pre>Paul's middle name is Sumner, which is important as it distinguishes him from other Paul Downeys.

Paul is BT's Chief Web Services Architect and represents BT at various organisations including the ~W3C, OASIS and the ~WS-I. An inveterate hacker, he passionately believes in the commons, loves the Web and advocates open source given any opportunity.

If you're popping in to the office, Paul will have a cappuccino with no chocolate and a plain croissant.

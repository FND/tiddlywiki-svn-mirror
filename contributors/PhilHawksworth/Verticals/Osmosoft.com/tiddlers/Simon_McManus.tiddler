<pre>Within his first year working at BT Simon produced ~MyPages, a Facebook/~MySpace style collaborative and social networking site. ~MyPages generated so much traffic that the system had to be shut down.

When not on his boat Simon likes to hack things together and make them do things they were never designed for.

If you're popping in to the office, Simon will have a cup of tea with milk and sugar and a chocolate muffin.

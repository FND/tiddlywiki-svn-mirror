Today we are celebrating the 3rd anniversary of TiddlyWiki! This morning we recorded [[an interview|TiddlyWiki anniversary interview]] between [[Jeremy Ruston]], creator of TiddlyWiki, [[Saq Imtiaz|http://blog.lewcid.org/]], a prolific contributor to the TiddlyWiki community, and [[Phil Whitehouse]], an [[Osmosoftonian]]. Jeremy talks about the history of TiddlyWiki and answers questions coming in over the [[IRC channel]]. You can see the recording by clicking on the screenshot.

We have [[several members|http://www.hawksworx.com/journal/2007/09/21/meeting-tiddlywiki-enthusiasts/]] of the TiddlyWiki community visiting us this week - it's turning out to be a great opportunity to talk about Osmosoft, open source and TiddlyWiki, and what BT's acquisition means for the future development of TiddlyWiki. We're celebrating tonight with Mojito's - if you're in the area, give us a call!</pre>

<pre>Jon has been on the scene for just under two years but is making a name for himself as someone who really &quot;gets&quot; the web and how it affects our lives.

Jon is an able technologist and is particularly keen on showing how much &quot;programming&quot; you can do these days without being able to code.

If you're popping in to the office, Jon will have a cappuccino and a pain au chocolat.

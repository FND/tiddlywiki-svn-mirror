<pre>Phil has been working at a variety of web agencies since 2000, and has the scars to prove it.

Phil is a project manager by trade, and he doesn't know how to code. He likes to bask in the reflected glory of programmers. He also has an unhealthy obsession with William Shatner.

If you're popping in to the office, Phil will have an americano with milk and sugar, and a chocolate chip muffin.

<pre>Welcome to iPhoneTiddlyWiki, a plugin to optimise TiddlyWiki for use on the iPhone. It's currently based on the ordinary TiddlyWiki 2.2.4 distribution, and so is VerySlow.

Actually, it's not really just for the iPhone, the aim is that this works well on other full-featured mobile browsers, like Opera.</pre>

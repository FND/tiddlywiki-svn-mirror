Not much good on it's own - it provides some nice functions to create graphicsy plugins.
Currently provides horsepower to the following plugins amongst others:
GeoTiddlyWiki (http://www.jonrobson.me.uk/workspaces/tiddlers/GeoTiddlyWiki/), ImageTaggingPlugin, TiddlyTagMindMap (http://tiddlytagmindmap.tiddlyspot.com)

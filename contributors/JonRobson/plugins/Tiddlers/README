About
##########
Tiddlers is a macro that allows you to create lists of tiddlers using TiddlyWiki's filter syntax. It works a bit like a loop.

<<tiddlers ExampleTemplate filter:[tag[horror]]>>
will pass all tiddlers with the tag horror through the tiddler ExampleTemplate. 
If only one tiddler is tagged horror eg. "Pyscho" and the ExampleTemplate has text "<<view title>> is the name of the film"...
... you will see "Pyscho is the name of the film" as the result of the macro

It also supports optional arguments:

*Dealing with empty filter matches
ifNone:<tiddler title> //define an alternative tiddler to display in this event
ifEmptyString:<string> // allows you to print a string in this event

You may be interested in my other plugin AdvancedFilterTiddlersPlugin which extends the filter syntax.

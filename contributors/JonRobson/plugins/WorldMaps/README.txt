Here lie lots of demos using the VismoThingsLibary that is used within GeoTiddlyWiki showing that it can be used outside the TiddlyWiki environment.

canvasMaps3D.js is the file you need to add Geo functionality.
To generate the latest version please run the script generate_canvasmaps
eg. in command line type
 ./generate_canvasmaps
this will merge the latest files in the js folder.
The source should be up to date but if you want to make sure do this :)

For some examples of usage please go into the examples folder.

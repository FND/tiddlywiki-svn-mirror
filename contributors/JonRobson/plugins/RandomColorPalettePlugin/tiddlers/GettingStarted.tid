<<RandomColorPaletteButton>>

!The macros
{{{<<RandomColorPalette>>}}} is a run once macro which picks a random colour scheme for your TiddlyWiki, saving a new ColorPalette tiddler on completion.
This is useful if you want the color palette to change when a certain tiddler is opened. If your particular whacky you could make it change every time you display a new tiddler by adding the macro to the ViewTemplate.

{{{<<RandomColorPaletteButton>>}}} gives you a button that you can be used to pick a random colour scheme.

This tiddler has special data inside it that defines a colour for France. This property is called fill and can be edited by clicking edit in the top right. This could be useful if you are planning to show certain data of a certain type about the world. For example you could change the colour depending on the population of a country to have a graphical representation of populous (and non-populous) countries in the world.

Welcome to GeoTiddlyWiki. This page is designed to give you a quick outline of what GeoTiddlyWiki can do for you. First things first you will have noticed a map below. This has been created by simply calling a macro {{{<<geo>>}}}. Click edit in the top right if you don't believe me!
<<geo width:400px height:200px id:world>>
Lovely, but it's not telling us much. Let's do some cool things with it..
First things first you may have noticed France is green. So lets go to [[FRANCE]] and find out why.

More advanced users may feel free to dive into where the data for this map is coming from. If that's you please have a look at this tiddler containing a geojson file which defines the data for this visualisation: [[geojson]].

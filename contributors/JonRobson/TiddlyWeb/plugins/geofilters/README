A TiddlyWeb plugin that provides ability to query tiddlers with geodata near a given location

This provides a new filter for TiddlyWeb aimed at geotiddlers (tiddlers containing longitude and latitude information expressed in fields with names "geo.long" and "geo.lat respectively")

It adds a near filter which allows you to query tiddlers by proximity
the argument given is comma separated with latitude first, longitude second and radius third.
eg.

tiddlers/bag/geotiddlers?near=50,0,5km

you can also request in miles
tiddlers/bag/geotiddlers?near=50,0,5miles

The resulting distance (in miles or kms depending on what was called) is added to a temporary tiddler field called "_geo.proximity"

To install
Simply update your tiddlywebconfig to supply the following.
    config = {
        'system_plugins': ['tiddlywebplugins.ltgt','tiddlywebplugins.geofilters'],
    }

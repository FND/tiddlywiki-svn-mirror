A TiddlyWeb plugin that provides the ability for users to score tiddlers.
Can use for rating a tiddler (1-5 or +1/-1)

##########
##usage###
##########
/tiddlyvoting?title=<title>&bag=<bag>&value=<value>
on the tiddler with title <title> in bag <bag> the field tiddlyvotes.total will be incremented by <value> and the field tiddlyvotes.mode will be updated with a number representing the most commonly used value and tiddlyvotes.average will be the average of all values applied to that tiddler

to work, the user must have read access to the bag <bag>

##data accuracy####
###########
Obviously if someone has write access to a bag they can manually alter the rating on the given tiddler. 
To prevent this a tiddler validator is installed. It will detect any changes to tiddlyvoting and make sure the result has not been tampered with.
Just make sure the bag you are allowing voting on is setup to use validators (make sure ACCEPT in the policy is ['NONE'])
As a result you cannot use the tiddlyvoting.total,tiddlyvoting.mode or tiddlyvoting.average fields on any tiddler for another purpose.

###########
##config####
###########
You can define more complex behaviours by using tiddler slices in the text of a tiddler called config::<bagname> in the tiddlyvoting bag.
So far the behaviours you can define are...
increment.range::0,10
increment.limit:2

increment.range sets the values which can be used for voting. In the above example any votes of value greater than 10 or less than 0 do not count.
increment.limit limits the votes a single user can cast on any tiddler. So if a user tries to vote a 3rd time in the above example the vote will be rejected

This adds a less than (lt) and greater than (gt) filter to TiddlyWeb

Field value is converted to a float

eg. Less than 
?lt=fieldname:4
would give you all tiddlers with a field 'fieldname' who's value is less than 4
eg. this would match tiddlers with field 'fieldname' =1,'fieldname' =2,'fieldname' =2.5 etc..
but would not match 'fieldname' =4 or 'fieldname' =5.

If the field is one of modified or created, the value given is treated as a date in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS form
eg. gt=modified:20100109 would give you all tiddlers which have been modified since 9th January 2010. Note hours, minutes and seconds are optional.

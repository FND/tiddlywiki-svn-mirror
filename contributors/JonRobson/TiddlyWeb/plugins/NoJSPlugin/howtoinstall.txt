This plugin allows viewers to see your TiddlyWiki in non-js form. It takes into account your custom PageTemplate, ViewTemplate and Stylesheets to provide a familiar view which resorts to javascript where possible. Why? search engine optimisation and maintain the same experience for both non-js and js users.

Simply add the templates folder to your TiddlyWeb root directory (where your config file is)
Put the nojs.py in the same folder
then edit your config file so it has "nojs" in system_plugins
eg.'system_plugins': ["nojs",...]
Access a tiddlers bag and nojs will be the default viewing mechanism.

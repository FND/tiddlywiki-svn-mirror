You'll need Jinja2 installed.
easy_install jinja2 should do it. If you have issues it might be to do with speedups- go google that and you'll find answers. 
You also need tiddlywebplugins installed. I need some wikifier functions to do this.
This plugin allows viewers to see your TiddlyWiki in non-js form. It takes into account your custom PageTemplate, ViewTemplate and Stylesheets to provide a familiar view which resorts to javascript where possible. Why? search engine optimisation and maintain the same experience for both non-js and js users.

Simply add the templates folder to your TiddlyWeb root directory (where your config file is)
Put the nojs.py in the same folder
then edit your config file so it has "nojs" in system_plugins
eg.'system_plugins': ["nojs",...]
Access a tiddlers bag and nojs will be the default viewing mechanism.

A TiddlyWeb plugin that allows you to import rss feeds to bags through a twanager command


Each item in an rss feed is mapped to a tiddler by the following rules

title: 
  guid / id attribute (preferred)
  OR url with ":","/" and "." replaced with "_" character
text:
  The text by default is saved as a link <html><p><b><a href='{{rss link}}'>{{rss title}}</a><br>{{rss description}} </p></html>
geo.long and geo.lat:
  if geo data is present, the longitude and latitude will be matched to these feeds
modifier:
  the author of the rss item
modified:
  the date field is used if present if not then the current date on time of command is taken

You can also create customisations by providing a handler. For example:

1) add to tiddlywebconfig
"imrss":{"module": "my_module"}
2) create a module my_module.py, inside which paste
def generic_handler(url,tiddler,feed_entry,feed=False,host=""):
  tiddler.text = "foo"
  return tiddler
3) run twanager imrss http://rssurl foo

The result will be tiddlers in foo from the rss feed, all with "foo" as the text. Obviously this example is rubbish but hopefully it gives you a starting point to explore further customisations.

In order of their distances from the Sun, the planets are [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] ( [[Image:Mercury symbol.svg|8px|{{unicode|☿}}]] ), [[Venus]] ( [[Image:Venus symbol.svg|8px|unicode|♀}}]] ), [[Earth]] ( [[Image:Earth symbol.svg|8px|{{unicode|⊕}}]] ), [[Mars]] ( [[Image:Mars symbol.svg|10px|{{unicode|♂}}]] ), [[Jupiter]] ( [[Image:Jupiter symbol.svg|10px|{{unicode|♃}}]] ), [[Saturn]] ( [[Image:Saturn symbol.svg|8px|{{unicode|♄}}]] ), [[Uranus]] ( [[Image:Uranus symbol.svg|8px|{{unicode|♅}}/[[Image:X - Uranus B.png|8px]]]] ), and [[Neptune]] ( [[Image:Neptune symbol.svg|10px|{{unicode|♆}}]] ). All planets but two are in turn orbited by [[natural satellite]]s (usually termed &quot;moons&quot; after Earth's [[Moon]]), and every planet past the [[asteroid belt]] is encircled by [[planetary ring]]s of dust and other particles. The planets, with the exception of Earth, are named after gods and goddesses from [[Greek mythology|Greco]]-[[Roman mythology|Roman]] [[mythology]]. \n\nFrom 1930 to 2006, [[Pluto]] ( [[Image:Pluto symbol.svg|8px|{{unicode|♇}}]] ),  one of the largest known [[Kuiper belt]] objects, was considered the Solar System's ninth planet. However, in  2006 the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) created an official [[2006 redefinition of planet|definition of the term &quot;planet&quot;]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iau2006.org/mirror/www.iau.org/iau0603/index.html IAU Resolutions, including 5a - Definition of a planet]&lt;/ref&gt;. Under this definition, Pluto is reclassified as a [[dwarf planet]], and there are eight planets in the Solar System. In addition to Pluto, the IAU currently recognizes two other [[dwarf planet]]s: [[1 Ceres|Ceres]] ( [[Image:1 Ceres (2).png|8px|Old symbol of Ceres]] ) , the largest asteroid,   and [[136199 Eris|Eris]], which lies beyond the Kuiper belt in a region called the scattered disc.  Of the known dwarf planets, only Ceres has no moons.\n\nFor many years, the Solar System was the only known example of planets in orbit around a star. The discovery in recent years of many [[extrasolar planet]]s has led to the term &quot;solar system&quot; being applied  generically to all [[stellar system]]s. Technically, however, it should strictly refer to Earth's system only, as the word &quot;[[solar]]&quot; is derived from the Sun's [[Latin]] name, ''[[Sol]]''. Other stellar systems or [[planetary system]]s are usually referred to by the names of their parent star; &quot;the [[Alpha Centauri]] system&quot; or &quot;the [[51 Pegasi]] system&quot;.\n\n[[Capitalization]] of the name varies.  The IAU, the authoritative body regarding astronomical nomenclature, specifies [http://www.iau.org/SPELLING_OF_NAMES.240.0.html capitalizing the names of all individual astronomical objects] ('''Solar System'''). However, the name is commonly rendered in lower case ('''solar system''') including in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', [http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/solar%20system ''Merriam-Webster's 11th Collegiate Dictionary''], and [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110143 ''Encyclopædia Britannica''].\n\n==Layout==\n[[Image:solarsystem.jpg|thumb|200 px|The ecliptic viewed in sunlight from behind the Moon in this [[Clementine mission|Clementine]] image. From left left to right: Mercury, Mars, Saturn]]\nMost objects in orbit round the Sun lie within the same shallow plane, called the [[ecliptic]], which is roughly parallel to the Sun's equator. The planets lie very close to the ecliptic, while [[comets]] and [[kuiper belt objects]] often lie at significant angles to it. All of the planets, and most other objects, also orbit with the Sun's rotation in a counter-clockwise direction as viewed from a point above the Sun's north pole. There is a direct relationship between how far away a planet is from the Sun, and how quickly it orbits. Mercury, with the smallest orbital circumference, travels the fastest, while Neptune, being much farther from the Sun, travels more slowly.\n\nA planet's distance from the Sun varies in the course of its year. Its closest approach to the Sun is known as its [[perihelion]], while its farthest point from the Sun is called its [[aphelion]]. Though planets follow nearly circular orbits, with perihelions roughly equal to their aphelions, many comets, asteroids and objects of the Kuiper belt follow highly elliptical orbits, with large differences between perihelion and aphelion.\n\nAstronomers most often measure distances within the solar system in [[astronomical unit]]s, or AU. One AU is the average distance between the Earth and the Sun, or roughly 149 598 000&amp;nbsp;km (93,000,000 mi).  [[Pluto]] is roughly 38&amp;nbsp;AU from the Sun, while [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]] lies at roughly 5.2&amp;nbsp;AU.\n\nInformally, the Solar System is sometimes divided into separate &quot;zones&quot;; the first zone, known as the '''inner Solar System''', comprises the '''inner planets''' and the main asteroid belt. The [[outer solar system]] is sometimes defined as everything beyond the asteroids; however, it is also the name often given to the region beyond Neptune, with the gas giants as a separate &quot;middle zone.&quot; \n  \n[[Image:Oort_cloud_Sedna_orbit.jpg|thumb|200 px|The orbits of the bodies in the solar system to scale (clockwise from top left)]]\nOne common misconception with regards to the Solar System is that the orbits of the major objects (planets, Pluto, and asteroids) are equidistant. Due to the vast distances involved, many representations of the Solar System tend to simplify these orbits, with equal spacing between each object. However, with certain exceptions, it can generally be stated that the farther a planet or belt is from the Sun, the greater the distance between it and the previous orbit. For example, [[Venus]] is approximately 0.33 AU farther out than [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], whereas [[Jupiter]] lies 1.9 AU from the farthest extent of the [[asteroid belt]], and Neptune's orbit is roughly 20 AU farther out than that of Uranus. Attempts have been made to determine a correlation between these distances (see [[Bode's Law]]) but to date there is no accepted theory that explains the respective orbital distances.\n\n== Planets, dwarf planets, and small solar system bodies ==\n[[Image:UpdatedPlanets2006.jpg|right|400px|thumb|Planets and Dwarf Planets of the solar system.]]\n{{Main|Planet|Dwarf planet|Small solar system body}}\n{{Further|[[2006 redefinition of planet]]}}\nA '''[[planet]]''', according to the recent definition passed by the [[International Astronomical Union]] General Assembly on August 24, 2006, is any body in orbit around the Sun that a) has enough mass to form itself into a spherical shape and b) has cleared its immediate neighborhood of all smaller objects. Eight objects in the Solar System currently meet this definition; they are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.\n\n'''[[Dwarf planet]]''' is a newly defined classification for stellar objects. The key difference between planets and dwarf planets is that while both are required to orbit the Sun and be of large enough mass that their own gravity pulls them into a nearly round shape, dwarf planets are not required to [[Clearing the neighborhood|clear their neighborhood]] of other celestial bodies. Three objects in the solar system are currently included in this category; they are [[Pluto]] (formerly considered a planet), the asteroid [[1 Ceres|Ceres]], and the [[scattered disc]] object [[136199 Eris|Eris]]. The IAU will begin evaluating other known objects to see if they fit within the definition of dwarf planets.  The most likely candidates are some of the larger asteroids and several Trans-Neptunian Objects such as [[90377 Sedna|Sedna]], [[90482 Orcus|Orcus]], and [[50000 Quaoar|Quaoar]].\n\nThe remainder of the objects in the Solar System were classified as '''[[small solar system bodies]]'''. A small solar system body ('''SSSB''') is a term [[2006 redefinition of planet|defined in 2006]] by the [[International Astronomical Union]] to describe Solar System objects which are neither [[planet]]s nor [[dwarf planet]]s.\n:''All other objects ... orbiting the Sun shall be referred to collectively as &quot;Small Solar System Bodies&quot; .... These currently include most of the Solar System asteroids, most Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs), comets, and other small bodies.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iau2006.org/mirror/www.iau.org/iau0602/index.html Definitions as voted on]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAs of 2006, the IAU considers the following bodies to be SSSB's: \n# all [[asteroids]] except [[1 Ceres|Ceres]]\n# all [[Centaur (planetoid)|centaur]]s\n# all [[trans-Neptunian objects]], including [[Kuiper belt]] &amp; [[Scattered disc]] objects, with the exception of [[Pluto]] and [[136199 Eris|Eris]]\n# all [[comets]]\n\n==Formation==\n[[Image:Ra4-protoplanetary-disk.jpg|thumb|300 px|Artist's conception of a [[protoplanetary disc]]]]\n{{main|Formation and evolution of the solar system}}\nThe current hypothesis of Solar System formation is the [[nebular hypothesis]], first proposed in 1755 by [[Immanuel Kant]] and independently formulated by [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |year=1909| title= The Past History of the Earth as Inferred from the Mode of Formation of the Solar System|work= American Philosophical Society|url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0003-049X%28190901%2F04%2948%3A191%3C119%3ATPHOTE%3E2.0.CO%3B2-U&amp;size=LARGE|accessdate=2006-07-23}} &lt;/ref&gt; The nebular theory holds that the Solar System was formed from the gravitational collapse of a gaseous cloud called the [[solar nebula]]. It had a diameter of 100&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical Unit|AU]] and was 2–3 times the mass of the Sun. Over time, a disturbance (possibly a nearby [[supernova]]) squeezed the nebula, pushing matter inward until gravitational forces overcame the internal gas pressure and it began to collapse. As the nebula collapsed, conservation of [[angular momentum]] meant that it spun faster, and became warmer. As the competing forces associated with gravity, gas pressure, magnetic fields, and rotation acted on it, the contracting nebula began to flatten into a spinning [[protoplanetary disk]] with a gradually contracting [[protostar]] at the center.\n\nFrom this cloud and its gas and dust, the various planets formed. The inner solar system was too warm for volatile molecules like water and methane to condense, and so the planetesimals which formed there were relatively small (comprising only 0.6% the mass of the disc) and composed largely of compounds with high melting points, such as [[silicate]]s and [[metal]]s. These rocky bodies eventually became the [[terrestrial planets]]. Farther out, the gravitational effects of [[Jupiter]] made it impossible for the protoplanetary objects present to come together, leaving behind the [[asteroid belt]]. Farther out still, beyond the [[frost line (astrophysics)|frost line]], [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] developed as large [[gas giants]], while [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]] captured much less gas and are known as ice giants because their cores are believed to be made mostly of ice, that is, hydrogen compounds.\n\nThe gas giants were massive enough to retain a &quot;primary atmosphere&quot; of hydrogen and helium captured from the surrounding solar nebula. The terrestrial planets eventually lost their retained hydrogen and helium, and subsequently generated their own &quot;secondary atmospheres&quot; via volcanism, comet impacts, and, also in Earth's case, the evolution of life.\n\nAfter 100 million years, the pressure and density of hydrogen in the centre of the collapsing nebula became great enough for the [[protostar|protosun]] to begin [[thermonuclear fusion]], which increased until [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] was achieved.\nThe young Sun's [[solar wind]] then cleared away all the gas and dust in the [[protoplanetary disk]], blowing it into interstellar space, thus ending the growth of the planets.\n\n==Sun==\n{{main|Sun}}\n[[Image:The sun1.jpg|thumb|200px|The Sun as seen from Earth.]]\nThe [[Sun]] is the Solar System's parent star, and far and away its chief component. It is classed as a moderately large [[yellow dwarf]]. However, this name is misleading, as on the scale of stars in our galaxy, the Sun is rather large and bright. Stars are classified based on their position on the [[Hertzsprung-Russell diagram]], a graph which plots the brightness of stars against their surface temperature. Generally speaking, the hotter a star is, the brighter it is. Stars which follow this pattern are said to be on the [[main sequence]], and the Sun lies right in the middle of it. This has led many astronomy textbooks to label the Sun as &quot;average;&quot; however, stars brighter and hotter than it are rare, whereas stars dimmer and cooler than it are common. The vast majority of stars are dim [[red dwarfs]], though they are under-represented in star catalogues as we can observe only those few that are very near the Sun in space.\n\nThe Sun's position on the [[main sequence]] means, according to current theories of stellar evolution, that it is in the &quot;prime of life&quot; for a star, in that it has not yet exhausted its store of hydrogen for [[nuclear fusion]], and been forced, as older [[red giants]] must, to fuse more inefficient elements such as [[helium]] and [[carbon]]. The Sun is growing increasingly bright as it ages. Early in its history, it was roughly 75 percent as bright as it is today.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kasting&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| last=Kasting| first=J.F.| coauthors=Ackerman, T.P.| year=1986| title=Climatic Consequences of Very High Carbon Dioxide Levels in the Earth’s Early Atmosphere| journal=Science| volume=234| pages=1383-1385}}&lt;/ref&gt;Calculations of the ratios of hydrogen and helium within the Sun suggest it is roughly halfway through its life cycle, and will eventually begin moving off the main sequence, becoming larger, brighter and redder, until, about five billion years from now, it too will become a red giant.\n\nThe Sun is a [[Metal-rich|population I]] star, meaning that it is fairly new in galactic terms, having been born in the later stages of the universe's evolution. As such, it contains far more elements heavier than hydrogen and helium (&quot;[[Metallicity|metals]]&quot; in astronomical parlance) than older [[Stellar classification|population II]] stars such as those found in [[globular clusters]]. Since elements heavier than hydrogen and helium were formed in the cores of ancient and exploding stars, the first generation of stars had to die before the universe could be enriched with them. For this reason, the very oldest stars contain very little &quot;metal&quot;, while stars born later have more. This high &quot;metallicity&quot; is thought to have been crucial in the Sun's developing a [[planetary system]], because planets form from accretion of metals.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| title=An Estimate of the Age Distribution of Terrestrial Planets in the Universe: Quantifying Metallicity as a Selection Effect|author=Charles H.

This environment is known as the [[interplanetary medium]]. Small quantities of [[cosmic dust]] (some of it arguably [[interstellar]] in origin) are also present in the [[interplanetary medium]] and are responsible for the phenomenon of [[zodiacal light]]. The influence of the Sun's rotating magnetic field on the interplanetary medium creates the largest structure in the solar system, the [[heliospheric current sheet]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| title=Artist's Conception of the Heliospheric Current Sheet| work=Wilcox Solar Observatory | url=http://quake.stanford.edu/~wso/gifs/HCS.html| accessdate=2006-06-22}} &lt;/ref&gt;\n\nEarth's [[magnetic field]] protects its atmosphere from interacting with the solar wind. However, Venus and Mars do not have magnetic fields, and the solar wind causes their atmospheres to gradually bleed away into space.\n\n==Inner planets==\n{{main|Terrestrial planet}}\n[[Image:Terrestrial planet size comparisons.jpg|thumb|300 px|The inner planets. From left to right: [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Earth]], and [[Mars]] (sizes to scale)]]\nThe four '''inner''' or [[terrestrial planet]]s are characterised by their dense, [[rock (geology)|rocky]] composition, few or no moons, and lack of ring systems. They are composed largely of minerals with high melting points such as [[silicates]] to form the planets' solid [[crust (geology)|crusts]] and semi-liquid [[mantle (geology)|mantle]]s, and metallic dust grains such as [[iron]], which forms their [[planetary core|cores]]. Three of the four inner planets have atmospheres. All have [[impact crater]]s, and all but one possess tectonic surface features, such as [[rift valley]]s and [[volcanoes]]. The term ''inner planet'' should not be confused with '''[[inferior planet]]''', which designates those planets which are closer to the Sun than the Earth is (i.e. Mercury and Venus).\n\nThe four inner planets are:\n\n===Mercury===\n'''[[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]''' (0.4&amp;nbsp;AU), the closest planet to the Sun, is also the least massive of the planets, at only 0.055 Earth masses. Mercury has a very thin atmosphere consisting of atoms blasted off its surface by the solar wind. Because Mercury is so hot, these atoms quickly escape into space. Thus in contrast to the Earth and Venus whose atmospheres are stable, Mercury's atmosphere is constantly being replenished.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |year= 2006| author= Bill Arnett| title=Mercury| work=The Nine Planets| url=http://www.nineplanets.org/mercury.html\n| accessdate=2006-09-14}} &lt;/ref&gt; Mercury is surrounded by an extremely small amount of helium, hydrogen, oxygen, and sodium. This envelope of gases is so thin that the greatest possible atmospheric pressure (force exerted by the weight of gases) on Mercury would be about 0.000000000002 kg/cm² (0.00000000003 psi). The atmospheric pressure on the Earth is about 1.03 kg/cm² (14.7 psi).&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |year= 2006| author= NASA| title=NASA - Mercury| work=NASA World Book| url=http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/mercury_worldbook.html\n| accessdate=2006-09-14}} &lt;/ref&gt; It has no [[natural satellite]], and, to date, no observed geological activity save that produced by [[impact event|impact]]s. Its relatively large iron core and thin mantle have not yet been adequately explained. Hypotheses include that its outer layers were stripped off by a giant impact, and that it was prevented from fully accreting by the Sun's gravity. The [[MESSENGER]] probe should aid in resolving this issue when it arrives in Mercury's orbit in 2011.\n\n===Venus===\n'''[[Venus]]''' (0.7&amp;nbsp;AU), the first truly terrestrial planet, is of comparable mass to the [[Earth (planet)|Earth]] (0.815 Earth masses), and, like Earth, possesses a thick silicate mantle around an iron core, as well as a substantial [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]] and evidence of one-time internal geological activity, such as [[volcanoes]]. However, it is much drier than Earth and its atmosphere is 90 times as dense and is composed overwhelmingly of [[carbon dioxide]] and [[sulfuric acid]]. Unlike Earth, evidence suggests that Venus's crust is not divided into [[tectonic plates]] but instead comprises a single very thick rind.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |year= 2006| author= Paul Rincon| title=Doubt cast on Venus catastrophe| work=BBC News| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4815230.stm\n| accessdate=2006-07-01}} &lt;/ref&gt; Venus has no natural satellite.

For this reason some astronomers suggested that they belong in their own category, “Uranian planets,” or “ice giants.” All four of the gas giants exhibit orbital debris rings, although only the ring system of Saturn is easily observable from Earth. The term ''outer planet'' should not be confused with '''[[superior planet]]''', which designates those planets which lie outside [[Earth]]'s orbit (thus consisting of the outer planets plus [[Mars]]).\n\n===Jupiter===\n'''[[Jupiter]]''' (5.2&amp;nbsp;AU), at 318 Earth masses, is 2.5 times the mass of all the other planets put together. Its composition of largely [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] is not very different from that of the Sun. Jupiter's strong internal heat creates a number of semi-permanent features in its atmosphere, such as cloud bands and the [[Great Red Spot]]. Three of its 63 [[natural satellite|satellites]], [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], [[Io (moon)|Io]], and [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] share elements in common with the terrestrial planets, such as volcanism and internal heating. Ganymede has a larger diameter than [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]].\n\n===Saturn===\n'''[[Saturn]]''' (9.5&amp;nbsp;AU), famous for its extensive [[planetary ring|ring system]], has many qualities in common with Jupiter, including its atmospheric composition, though it is far less massive, being only 95 Earth masses. Two of its 49 moons, [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] and [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]], show signs of geological activity, though they are largely made of ice. Titan, like Ganymede, is larger than [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]; it is also the only satellite in the solar system with a substantial atmosphere.\n\n===Uranus===\n'''[[Uranus]]''' (19.6&amp;nbsp;AU) at 14 Earth masses, is the lightest of the outer planets. Uniquely among the planets, it orbits the Sun on its side; its [[axial tilt]] lies at over ninety degrees to the [[ecliptic]]. Its core is remarkably cold (compared with the other gas giants; it is still several thousand degrees Celsius) and radiates very little heat into space. Uranus has 27 satellites, the largest being [[Titania (moon)|Titania]], [[Oberon (moon)|Oberon]], [[Umbriel (moon)|Umbriel]], [[Ariel (moon)|Ariel]] and [[Miranda (moon)|Miranda]].\n\n===Neptune===\n'''[[Neptune]]''' (30&amp;nbsp;AU), though slightly smaller than Uranus, it is denser and slightly more massive, at 17 Earth masses, and radiates more internal heat than Uranus, but not as much as Jupiter or Saturn. Its peculiar ring system is composed of a number of dense &quot;arcs&quot; of material separated by gaps. Neptune has 13 moons. The largest, [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], is geologically active, with geysers of [[liquid nitrogen]].\n\n\n==Kuiper belt==\n[[Image:Kuiper oort.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Artist's rendering of the Kuiper Belt and hypothetical [[Oort cloud]].]]\nThe area beyond Neptune, often referred to as the [[outer solar system]] or simply the &quot;[[trans-Neptunian objects|trans-Neptunian region]]&quot;, is still largely unexplored.\n\nThis region's first formation, which actually begins inside the orbit of Neptune, is the '''[[Kuiper belt]]''', a great ring of debris, similar to the asteroid belt but composed mainly of ice and far greater in extent, which lies between 30 and 50&amp;nbsp;AU from the Sun. This region is thought to be the place of origin for short-period [[comet]]s, such as [[Halley's comet]]. Though it is composed mainly of [[small solar system bodies]], many of the largest Kuiper belt objects could soon be reclassified as dwarf planets. There are estimated to be over 100,000 [[Kuiper belt object]]s with a diameter greater than 50&amp;nbsp;km; however, the total mass of the Kuiper belt is relatively low, perhaps barely equalling the mass of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |year= 2003| author= SCOTT J.

Prior to the [[2006 redefinition of planet|2006 redefinitions]], [[Charon (planet)|Charon]] was considered a moon of Pluto, but in light of the redefinition it is unclear whether Charon will continue to be classified as a moon of Pluto or as a dwarf planet itself.  Charon does not orbit Pluto, but rather both bodies orbit a [[barycenter]] of gravity in empty space, making Pluto-Charon a [[binary system]]. Two much smaller moons, Nix and Hydra, orbit Pluto and Charon. \n\nThose Kuiper belt objects which, like Pluto, possess a 3:2 orbital resonance with Neptune (ie, they orbit twice for every three Neptunian orbits) are called [[Plutino]]s. Other Kuiper belt objects have different [[orbital resonance|resonant orbits]] (2:1, 4:7, 3:5 etc) and are grouped accordingly. The remaining Kuiper belt objects, in more &quot;classical&quot; orbits, are classified as [[Cubewano]]s.\n\n==Comets==\n\n[[Image:Comet c1995o1.jpg|right|thumb|100 px|Comet Hale-Bopp]]\n'''[[Comet]]s''' are [[small solar system bodies]] (usually only a few kilometres across) composed largely of volatile ices, which possess highly eccentric orbits, generally having a [[perihelion]] within the orbit of the inner planets and an [[aphelion]] far beyond Pluto. When a comet approaches the Sun, its icy surface begins to sublimate, or boil away, creating a [[coma (cometary)|coma]]; a long tail of gas and dust which is often visible with the naked eye.\n\nThere are two basic types of comet: short-period comets, with orbits less than 200 years, and long-period comets, with orbits lasting thousands of years. Short-period comets are believed to originate in the [[#Kuiper belt|Kuiper belt]], while long period comets, such as [[Hale-Bopp]] (pictured), are believed to originate in the [[Oort Cloud]]. Some comets with [[hyperbola|hyperbolic]] orbits may originate outside the solar system. Old comets that have had most of their volatiles driven out by solar warming are often categorized as asteroids.\n\n'''[[Centaur (planetoid)|Centaur]]s''' are icy comet-like bodies that have less-eccentric orbits so that they remain in the region between Jupiter and Neptune. The first centaur to be discovered, [[2060 Chiron]], has been called a comet since it has been shown to develop a coma just as comets do when they approach the sun.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |year= 1995| author=Patrick Vanouplines | title= Chiron biography| work=Vrije Universitiet Brussel| url=http://www.vub.ac.be/STER/www.astro/chibio.htm| accessdate=2006-06-23}} &lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Scattered disc==\n[[Image:TheKuiperBelt_Projections_100AU_Classical_SDO.svg|thumb|right|200px|Black: scattered disc; blue: classical Kuiper belt; green: resonant KBOs inc.

Scattered disc objects are believed to have been originally native to the Kuiper belt, but were ejected into erratic orbits in the outer fringes by the gravitational influence of Neptune's outward migration (''see [[Formation and evolution of the solar system#Outer planets|Formation and evolution of the Solar System]]''). Most scattered disc objects have perihelia within the Kuiper belt but aphelia as far as 150&amp;nbsp;AU from the Sun. Their orbits are also highly inclined to the ecliptic plane, and are often almost perpendicular to it. Some astronomers, such as Kuiper belt co-discoverer [[David Jewitt]], consider the scattered disc to be merely another region of the Kuiper belt, and describe scattered disc objects as &quot;scattered Kuiper belt objects.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |year= 2005| author= David Jewitt| title=The 1000 km Scale KBOs| work=University of Hawaii| url=http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/faculty/jewitt/kb/big_kbo.html| accessdate=2006-07-16}} &lt;/ref&gt; \n\n===Eris===\n[[Image:Xenaandgabrielle.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Eris and its moon [[Dysnomia (moon)|Dysnomia]]]]\n'''[[136199 Eris|Eris]]''' (68 AU average) is the largest known [[#scattered disc|scattered disc object]] and was the cause of the most recent debate about [[Definition of planet|what constitutes a planet]] since it is at least 5% larger than Pluto with an estimated diameter of 2400&amp;nbsp;km (1500&amp;nbsp;mi).

It is generally accepted, however, that the Sun's gravity holds sway to the '''[[Oort cloud]]'''.

It has been hypothesised that while the giant planets in these systems formed in the same place as the gas giants in Earth's solar system did, some sort of migration took place which resulted in the giant planet spiralling in towards the parent star. Any terrestrial planets which had previously existed would presumably either be destroyed or ejected from the system.  On the other hand, the apparent prevalence of hot Jupiters could result from a [[sampling error]], as planets of similar size at greater distances from their stars are more difficult to detect.\n\n==Discovery and exploration==\n{{main|Geocentric model|Heliocentrism|Space exploration}}\n\nFor many thousands of years, people, with a few notable exceptions, did not believe the solar system existed. The Earth was believed not only to be stationary at the centre of the [[universe]], but to be categorically different from the divine or ethereal objects that moved through the sky. The conceptual advances of the 17th century, led by [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], [[Galileo Galilei]], [[Johannes Kepler]], and [[Isaac Newton]], led gradually to the acceptance of the idea not only that Earth moved round the Sun, but that the planets were governed by the same laws that governed the Earth, and therefore could be similar to it.\n\n===Telescopic observations===\n[[Image:Galileo's telescope.jpg|thumb|150 px|Galileo's telescope]]\nThe first exploration of the solar system was conducted by telescope, with astronomers learning that the Moon and other planets possessed such Earthlike features as craters, ice caps, and seasons.\n\n[[Galileo Galilei]] was the first to notice the physical nature of our solar system. He discovered that the [[Moon]] was cratered, that the Sun was pocked with sunspots, and that Jupiter had four satellites in orbit around it. [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]] and [[Christian Huygens]] followed on from Galileo's discoveries by discovering the rings of Saturn, and Saturn's moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], respectively.\n\nIn 1682, [[Edmund Halley]] realised that repeated sightings of a [[comet]] were in fact recording the same object, returning regularly once every 75-6 years. This proved once and for all that comets were not atmospheric phenomena, as had been previously thought, and was the first evidence that anything other than the planets orbited the Sun.\n\nIn 1781, [[William Herschel]] was looking for binary stars in the constellation of [[Taurus]] when he observed what he thought was a new comet. In fact, its orbit revealed that it was a new planet, [[Uranus]], the first ever discovered.\n\nIn 1801, [[Giuseppe Piazzi]] discoverd [[1 Ceres|Ceres]], a small world between Mars and Jupiter that was initially considered a new planet. However, subsequent discoveries of thousands of other small worlds in the same region led to their eventual separate reclassification: [[asteroid]]s.\n\nIn 1846, discrepancies in the orbit of Uranus led many to suspect a large planet must be tugging at it from farther out. [[Urbain Le Verrier]]'s calculations eventually led to the discovery of [[Neptune]].\n\nFurther discrepancies in the orbits of the planets led [[Percival Lowell]] to conclude yet another planet, &quot;[[Planet X]]&quot; must still be out there. After his death, his Lowell Observatory conducted a search, which ultimately led to [[Clyde Tombaugh]]'s discovery of [[Pluto]] in 1930. Pluto was, however, found to be too small to have disrupted the orbits of the outer planets, and its discovery was therefore coincidental.  Like Ceres, it was initially considered to be a planet, but after the discovery of many other similarly sized objects in its vicinity it was eventually reclassified as a [[Kuiper belt object]].\n\n===Observations by spacecraft===\nSince the start of the [[space age]], a great deal of exploration has been performed by [[unmanned space missions]] that have been organized and executed by various space agencies. The first probe to [[Landings on other planets|land on another solar system body]] was the [[Soviet Union]]'s ''[[Luna 2]]'' probe, which impacted on the Moon in 1959. Since then, increasingly distant planets have been reached, with probes landing on [[Venus (planet)|Venus]] in 1965, [[Mars (planet)|Mars]] in 1976, the asteroid [[433 Eros]] in 2001, and [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] in 2005. Spacecraft have also made close approaches to other planets: ''[[Mariner 10]]'' passed [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] in 1973.\n\n[[Image:Lander small.jpg|thumb|200px|The planned [[Phoenix (spacecraft)|Phoenix]] Mars lander]]\nThe first probe to explore the outer planets was ''[[Pioneer 10]]'', which flew by [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]] in 1973. ''[[Pioneer 11]]'' was the first to visit [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]], in 1979. The [[Voyager program|''Voyager'']] probes performed a grand tour of the outer planets following their launch in 1977, with both probes passing Jupiter in 1979 and Saturn in 1980 &amp;ndash; 1981. ''[[Voyager 2]]'' then went on to make close approaches to [[Uranus (planet)|Uranus]] in 1986 and [[Neptune (planet)|Neptune]] in 1989. The ''Voyager'' probes are now far beyond [[Neptune (planet)|Neptune]]'s orbit, and astronomers anticipate that they will encounter the [[heliopause]] which defines the outer edge of the solar system in the next few years.\n&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year= 2005| title=Voyager Interstellar Mission| Author=NASA/JPL| url=http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/interstellar.html| accessdate=2006-07-01}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |year= 2002| title= Time Line of Space Exploration| Author= Randy Culp| url=http://my.execpc.com/~culp/space/timeline.html| accessdate=2006-07-01}} &lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAll planets in the solar system have now been visited to varying degrees by spacecraft launched from Earth, the last being Neptune in 1989.  Through these unmanned missions, humans have been able to get close-up photographs of all of the planets and, in the case of landers, perform tests of the soils and [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmospheres]] of some.\n\nNo [[Kuiper belt object]] has been visited by a man-made spacecraft. Launched in [[19 January]], [[2006]], the ''[[New Horizons]]'' is currently enroute to becoming the first man-made spacecraft to explore this area. This [[Unmanned spacecraft|unmanned mission]] is scheduled to fly by Pluto in July 2015. Should it prove feasible, the mission will then be extended to observe a number of other Kuiper belt objects.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |year= 2006| title= New Horizons NASA's Pluto-Kuiper Belt Mission| url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/| accessdate=2006-07-01}} &lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==See also==\n* List of solar system objects: [[List of solar system objects|By orbit]]—[[List of solar system objects by mass|By mass]]—[[List of solar system objects by radius|By radius]]\n* [[Attributes of the largest solar system bodies]]\n* [[Titius-Bode law]]\n* [[Hypothetical planets]]\n* [[Astronomical symbols]]\n* [[Geological features of the solar system]]\n* [[Numerical model of solar system]]\n* [[Solar nebula]]\n* [[Table of planets and dwarf planets in the solar system|Table of planetary attributes]]\n* [[Timeline of discovery of solar system planets and their natural satellites]]\n* [[Timeline of solar system astronomy]]\n* [[Solar system model]]\n* [[Space colonization]]\n* [[Solar system in fiction]]\n* [[Celestia]] - Space-simulation on your computer (OpenGL)\n\n\n{{Solar_system_table}}\n\n==References==\n&lt;div class=&quot;references-small&quot;&gt;\n&lt;references/&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n==External links==\n{{sisterlinks|Solar system}}\n* [http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/index.cfm NASA's Solar System Exploration site]\n* [http://space.jpl.nasa.gov NASA's Solar System Simulator]\n* [http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/solar_system NASA/JPL Solar System main page]\n* [http://www.nineplanets.org/ The Nine Planets - Comprehensive solar system site by Bill Arnett]\n* [http://www.krysstal.com/solarsys_planets.html Planetary data]\n* [http://www.solstation.com/habitable.htm SolStation: Stars and Habitable Planets]\n* [http://www.space.com/solarsystem/ SPACE.com: All About the Solar System]\n* [http://www.wired.com/news/technology/space/0,71605-0.html?tw=wn_index_5 A Wired News article about the proposed 3 new planets to be voted on on August 24, 2006]\n* [http://space.wikia.com/wiki/Solar_system Space Wiki entry]\n* [http://www.classzone.com/books/earth_science/terc/content/visualizations/es2701/es2701page01.cfm?chapter_no=27 Illustration of the distance between planets]\n\n[[Category:IAU planet debate]]\n[[Category:Astronomy]]\n[[Category:Solar system]]\n\n[[af:Sonnestelsel]]\n[[als:Sonnensystem]]\n[[ar:نظام شمسي]]\n[[ast:Sistema solar]]\n[[zh-min-nan:Thài-iông-hē]]\n[[bs:Sunčev sistem]]\n[[br:Koskoriad an Heol]]\n[[bg:Слънчева система]]\n[[ca:Sistema solar]]\n[[cs:Sluneční soustava]]\n[[da:Solsystem]]\n[[de:Sonnensystem]]\n[[et:Päikesesüsteem]]\n[[el:Ηλιακό σύστημα]]\n[[es:Sistema Solar]]\n[[eo:Sunsistemo]]\n[[eu:Eguzki-sistema]]\n[[fa:منظومه شمسی]]\n[[fr:Système solaire]]\n[[fy:Sinnestelsel]]\n[[ga:Grianchóras]]\n[[gl:Sistema Solar]]\n[[gu:સૂર્યમંડળ]]\n[[ko:태양계]]\n[[hr:Sunčev sustav]]\n[[io:Sunala sistemo]]\n[[ilo:Sistema a Solar]]\n[[id:Tata Surya]]\n[[ia:Systema solar]]\n[[ie:Solari sistema]]\n[[is:Sólkerfið]]\n[[it:Sistema solare]]\n[[he:מערכת השמש]]\n[[sw:Mfumo wa jua na sayari zake]]\n[[ht:Sistèm solè]]\n[[ku:Pergala rojê]]\n[[la:Systema solare]]\n[[lv:Saules sistēma]]\n[[lt:Saulės sistema]]\n[[li:Zonnestèlsel]]\n[[hu:Naprendszer]]\n[[mk:Сончев систем]]\n[[ml:സൌരയൂഥം]]\n[[mt:Sistema Solari]]\n[[ms:Sistem suria]]\n[[mn:Нарны аймаг]]\n[[nl:Zonnestelsel]]\n[[nds-nl:Zunnesysteem]]\n[[ja:太陽系]]\n[[no:Solsystem]]\n[[nn:Solsystemet]]\n[[pam:Solar System]]\n[[nds:Sünnsystem]]\n[[pl:Układ Słoneczny]]\n[[pt:Sistema Solar]]\n[[ro:Sistem solar]]\n[[ru:Солнечная система]]\n[[sco:Solar seestem]]\n[[sq:Sistemi diellor]]\n[[scn:Sistema sulari]]\n[[simple:Solar system]]\n[[sk:Planetárna sústava]]\n[[sl:Osončje]]\n[[sh:Sunčev sistem]]\n[[fi:Aurinkokunta]]\n[[sv:Solsystem]]\n[[th:ระบบสุริยะ]]\n[[vi:Hệ Mặt Trời]]\n[[tr:Güneş Sistemi]]\n[[uk:Сонячна система]]\n[[zh-yue:太陽系]]\n[[zh:太阳系]]\n</div>

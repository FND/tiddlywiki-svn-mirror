Io shines at [[Apparent magnitude|magnitude]] 5.0 in the night sky. It is named after the [[Greek mythology|Greek mythological]] figure [[Io (mythology)|Io]], one of the many lovers of [[Zeus]] (who is also known as [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]] in the [[Roman mythology]]). Io is the fourth largest moon in the [[Solar System]].\n\nAlthough the name &quot;Io&quot; was suggested by [[Simon Marius]] soon after its discovery in 1610, this name and the names of the other Galilean satellites fell into disfavor for a considerable time, and were not revived in common use until the mid-20th century. In much of the earlier astronomical literature, Io is simply referred to by its [[Roman numeral]] designation as &quot;'''Jupiter I'''&quot;, or simply as &quot;the first satellite of Jupiter&quot;.\n\n==History of observation and exploration==\nThe moon Io is believed to have been discovered on [[7 January]], [[1610]] by [[Galileo]]. In his ''Mundus Jovialis'', published in [[1614]], [[Simon Marius]] claimed to have discovered Io and the other moons of Jupiter in [[1609]], one week before Galileo's discovery. Galileo doubted this claim and catalogued the work of Marius as plagiarism.\n\nIn the middle of the 20th century observations were made suggesting that the polar regions of Io were red. With the passage of the space probe, [[Pioneer program|Pioneer]] in the 1970s, little was discovered about Io. [[Pioneer 10]] was not able to obtain any clues regarding the radiation of Io. But, [[Pioneer 11]] was able to verify that the polar region had an orange color, contrasting with the whitish equator. At this altitude, it was already known that Io had an atmosphere.\n\nWhen the space probe, [[Voyager 1]] sent its first images near Io in 1979, the scientists found that Io had almost no craters. While analyzing images, Voyager navigation engineer [[Linda Hyder]] noticed a &quot;plume&quot; eminating from the surface.  Scientists found a relatively young surface caused by intense volcanic activity that covered any signs of craters. Voyager 1 was able to observe nine active volcanoes on the surface, and later [[Voyager 2]] observed eight of the nine active volcanoes. \n\nThe [[Galileo spacecraft]] arrived at Jupiter in 1995,  and flew by Io at the end of 1999. Galileo approached Io closer than any other probe, took many photographs, observed volcanoes erupting, and discovered that Io has a large iron core, like the rocky planets of the inner solar system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = R. M. C. Lopes, D. A. Williams| title = Io after Galileo| journal = Rep. Prog. Phys.| volume= 68 | year =2005 | pages=303–340  |doi= 10.1088/0034-4885/68/2/R02\n}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Physical characteristics==\n[[Image:PIA01129 Interior of Io.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Interior of Io]]\n===Internal Structure===\nUnlike most moons in the outer solar system, Io may be somewhat similar in bulk composition to the terrestrial planets, primarily composed of molten [[silicate]] [[Rock (geology)|rock]]. Recent data from the ''Galileo'' orbiter indicates that Io has a core of [[iron]] (perhaps mixed with [[Pyrite|iron sulfide]]), the core's radius being at least 900 km.&lt;ref name=core/&gt;Unlike the other Galilean satellites, Io has little or no water. This is probably because Jupiter was hot enough early in the evolution of the solar system to drive off the volatile elements in the vicinity of Io, but not hot enough to do so farther out. Io has the highest density out of all the moons in the [[Solar System]] and hence has the highest gravitational acceleration out of all the moons.\n\n[[Image:Iosurface gal.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Io exhibits extraordinary variations in color and brightness as shown in this color-enhanced image.]]\n===Surface Features===\nWhen ''Voyager 1'' first returned images of Io in 1979, scientists expected to see numerous craters, the density of which across Io's surface would give clues to the moon's age.  However, they were surprised to discover that Io's surface is almost completely lacking in [[Impact crater|crater]]s, due to the tremendous amount of volcanic activity constantly reshaping the landscape. Since the surface features visible today were formed relatively recently, the Ionian surface is described as &quot;young&quot;, as is the terrestrial surface. In contrast, celestial bodies with heavily cratered features, such as Earth's [[Moon]], are considered to have &quot;old&quot; surfaces, since they have remained in their current state for billions of years. The unusual features and colors on Io's surface have led to its being compared to a rotten [[orange (fruit)|orange]] or to [[pizza]].\n\nIn addition to volcanoes, Io's surface includes nonvolcanic mountains, numerous lakes of molten sulfur, [[caldera]]s up to several kilometres deep, and extensive flows hundreds of kilometres long of low-viscosity fluid (possibly some form of molten sulfur or silicate). Sulfur and its compounds take on a wide range of colors and are responsible for Io's variegated appearance. \n\n[[Image:Tvashtar Catena.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Tvashtar Paterae]], a region of active volcanism on Io]]\n\n===Volcanism===\nAnalysis of the ''Voyager'' images led scientists to believe that the [[lava]] flows on Io's surface were composed mostly of various compounds of molten sulfur. However, subsequent ground-based [[infrared]] studies indicate that they are too hot for liquid sulfur; some of the hottest spots on Io may reach temperatures as high as 2000&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]], 1300&amp;nbsp;K higher than the boiling point of sulfur, though the average is much lower, at around 130&amp;nbsp;K. One current theory is that Io's lavas are molten silicate rock. Recent [[Hubble Space Telescope]] observations indicate that the material may be rich in [[sodium]]. There may be a variety of different materials in different locations.&lt;ref name=hubble&gt;Roesler, F.

The eruption in the top inset reaches 140km high, the other is 75km high.]]\nIo is most noteworthy for its volcanic nature; it is the most volcanically active body in the [[Solar System]]. In February 2001, the largest recorded volcanic eruptions in the [[solar system]] occurred on Io.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/news/archive/eruption/| title=EXCEPTIONALLY BRIGHT ERUPTION ON IO RIVALS LARGEST IN SOLAR SYSTEM| publisher=Keck Observatory News| accessdate=2006-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[volcano]]es on [[Earth]], Ionian volcanoes emit [[sulfur]] and [[sulfur dioxide]]. Originally it was thought that many [[lava]] flows consisted of sulfurous [[chemical substance|substances]]. However, it is now believed that many of them are molten [[silicate]] rock as on the Earth.\n\nThe energy for this activity probably derives from [[tides|tidal]] interactions among Io, Jupiter, and two other moons of Jupiter, [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] and [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]]. The three moons are locked into [[orbital resonance|Laplace-resonant orbits]] such that Io orbits twice for each orbit of Europa, which in turn orbits twice for each orbit of Ganymede (Callisto will eventually join this resonance relationship as well); furthermore, Io always keeps the same face towards Jupiter. The gravitational interaction of Europa, Ganymede and Jupiter cause Io to &quot;stretch&quot; and &quot;bend&quot; by as much as 100 meters, a process which generates heat through internal friction.\n\nSome of Io's volcanic plumes have been measured rising over 300 km above the surface before falling back, with material ejected from the surface at approximately one kilometre per second. The volcanic eruptions change rapidly; in just four months between the arrivals of ''[[Voyager 1]]'' and ''[[Voyager 2]]'' some eruptions stopped and others began. The deposits surrounding the vents also changed visibly during this time. \n\nAnother source of energy is Jupiter's [[magnetic field]] lines, which Io crosses, generating an [[electric current]]. Though not a large source of energy compared to the tidal heating, this current may carry more than 1,000 [[watt|gigawatts]] with a potential of 400 [[volt|kilovolts]]. It also strips [[ion|ionized atoms]] from Io at the rate of a thousand kilograms per second. Due to the rapid rotation of Jupiter's magnetic field, these particles are swept along the orbit in front of Io where they form a torus of intense radiation around Jupiter that emits bright [[ultraviolet]] light. Particles escaping from this torus are partially responsible for Jupiter's unusually large [[magnetosphere]], their outward pressure inflating it from within. Recent data from the ''[[Galileo spacecraft|Galileo]]'' orbiter indicate that Io might have its own magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;Sarson, G.

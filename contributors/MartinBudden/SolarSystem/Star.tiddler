This fusion of [[Atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] generates the [[energy]] that is continuously [[radiation|radiated]] from the outer layers of the star during much of its life span.&lt;ref name=&quot;sunshine&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Bahcall | first = John N. | date = 2000-06-29 | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/articles/fusion/index.html | title = How the Sun Shines | publisher = Nobel Foundation | language = English | accessdate = 2006-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIndividual stars differ in their total mass, composition, and age. The total mass of a star is the principal determinant in its evolution and eventual fate. A [[Hertzsprung-Russell diagram]] shows the pattern of the temperature of stars against their absolute magnitude, and can be used to determine the age of a star and the stage in its evolution. Initially, stars are composed primarily of [[hydrogen]], with some [[helium]] and heavier trace elements that determine their [[metallicity]]. Over the course of a star's evolution, a portion of the hydrogen is converted into helium and smaller quantities of heavier elements through the process of nuclear fusion. Part of the matter is then recycled into the interstellar environment and used to form a new generation of more [[metal-rich]] stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://observe.arc.nasa.gov/nasa/space/stellardeath/stellardeath_intro.html | title = Stellar Evolution &amp; Death | publisher = NASA Observatorium | language = English | accessdate = 2006-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[Binary star|Binary]] and multi-star systems consist of two or more stars that are gravitationally bound, and generally move around each other in stable orbits.

They have been used in religious practices and for [[celestial navigation]] and orientation. The [[Gregorian calendar]], used nearly everywhere in the world, is a [[solar calendar]] based on the position of the [[Earth]] relative to the nearest star, the [[Sun]].\n\nEarly astronomers such as [[Tycho Brahe]] identified new stars in the heavens, suggesting that the heavens were not immutable. In 1584 [[Giordano Bruno]] suggested that the stars were actually other suns, and may have Earth-like planets in orbit around them.&lt;ref name=&quot;he history&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Drake | first = Stephen A. | date = 2006-08-17 | url = http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/headates/heahistory.html | title = A Brief History of High-Energy (X-ray &amp; Gamma-Ray) Astronomy | publisher = NASA HEASARC | language = English | accessdate = 2006-08-24\n}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the following century the idea of the stars as distant suns was reaching a consensus among astronomers, and it would be the theologian [[Richard Bentley]] who would prompt [[Isaac Newton]] to suggest that the stars were equally distributed in every direction, resulting in no net gravitational pull.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Hoskin | first = Michael | year=1998 | url = http://www.stsci.edu/stsci/meetings/lisa3/hoskinm.html | title = The Value of Archives in Writing the History of Astronomy | publisher = Space Telescope Science Institute | language = English | accessdate = 2006-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe Italian astronomer [[Geminiano Montanari]] recorded seeing variability in the star [[Algol]] 1667. [[Edmond Halley]] would then publish the first measurements of the [[proper motion]] of a pair of nearby &quot;fixed&quot; stars, demonstrating that they had changed position from the time of the ancient Greek astronomers [[Ptolemy]] and [[Hipparchus (astronomer)|Hipparchus]]. But it would not be until 1838 that the first direct measurement of the distance to the star [[61 Cygni]] was made by [[Friedrich Bessel]] using the [[parallax]] technique. Parallax measurements demonstrated the vast separation of the stars in the heavens.&lt;ref name=&quot;he history&quot; /&gt;\n\n===Star designations===\n{{main|star designation|astronomical naming conventions|Star catalogue}}\nThe concept of the [[constellation]] arose as far back in history as [[Babylon]]ian period. Ancient sky watchers imagined that prominent arrangements of stars formed patterns, and they associated these with particular aspects of nature or their myths. Twelve of these formations lay along the band of the [[ecliptic]] and these became the basis of [[astrology]]. Many of the more prominent individual stars were also given names, particularly with [[Arab language|Arabic]] or [[Latin language|Latin]] designations.\n\nAs well as certain [[constellation]]s and the [[Sun]] itself, stars as a whole have their own [[mythology|myth]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;mythology&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Coleman | first = Leslie S. | url = http://www.frostydrew.org/observatory/courses/myths/booklet.htm | title = Myths, Legends and Lore | publisher = Frosty Drew Observatory | language = English | accessdate = 2006-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were thought to be the souls of the dead or gods. An example of this is the star [[Algol]], which was thought to represents the eye of the [[Gorgon]] [[Medusa]].\n\nTo the [[Ancient Greek religion|Ancient Greek]]s, some &quot;stars&quot;, later identified as [[planet]]s, represented various important deities, from which the names of the planets [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] were taken.&lt;ref name=&quot;mythology&quot; /&gt; ([[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]] were also [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology|Roman gods]], but neither planet was known in Antiquity because of their low brightness. Their names were assigned by later astronomers.)\n\nAt about the year 1600, the names of the constellations were used to name the stars in the corresponding regions of the sky. The German astronomer [[Johann Bayer]] created a series of star maps and applied greek letters as [[Bayer designation|designations]] to the\nstars in each constellation. Later the English astronomer [[John Flamsteed]] came up with a system using numbers, which would later be known as the [[Flamsteed designation]]. Numerous additional systems have since been created as [[star catalogue]]s appeared.\n\nThe only body which has been recognized by the scientific community as having the authority to name stars or other celestial bodies is the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU).&lt;ref name=&quot;naming&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nmm.ac.uk/server/show/conWebDoc.309 | title = The Naming of Stars | publisher = National Maritime Museum | language = English | accessdate = 2006-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of private companies (for instance, the &quot;[[International Star Registry]]&quot;) purport to sell names to stars; however, these names are neither recognized by the scientific community nor used by them,&lt;ref name=&quot;naming&quot; /&gt; and many in the astronomy community view these organizations as [[fraud]]s preying on people ignorant of how stars are in fact named.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Adams | first = Cecil | date = 1998-04-01 | url = http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a3_385.html | title = Can you pay $35 to get a star named after you? | publisher = The Straight Dope | language = English | accessdate = 2006-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Units of measurement==\nMost stellar parameters are expressed in [[International System of Units|SI units]] by convention, but [[CGS unit]]s are also used (e.g., expressing luminosity in [[erg]]s per second). [[Mass]], [[luminosity]], and [[radius|radii]] are usually given in solar units, based on the characteristics of the [[Sun]]:\n\n{|\n|[[solar mass]]:\n|&lt;math&gt;M_\sbigodot = 1.9891 \stimes 10^{30}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[kilogram|kg]]\n|-\n|[[solar luminosity]]:\n|&lt;math&gt;L_\sbigodot = 3.827 \stimes 10^{26}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[watt]]s&lt;ref name=&quot;constants&quot; /&gt;\n|-\n|[[solar radius]]:\n|&lt;math&gt;R_\sbigodot = 6.960 \stimes 10^{8}&lt;/math&gt; [[meter|m]]\n|}\n\nLarge lengths, such as the radius of a giant star or the [[semi-major axis]] of a binary star system, are often expressed in terms of the [[astronomical unit]] (AU) &amp;mdash; approximately the mean distance between the Earth and the Sun.\n\n== Formation and evolution ==\n{{main|stellar evolution}}\nStars are formed within [[molecular cloud]]s; large regions of high density in the [[interstellar medium]] (though still less dense than the inside of an earthly [[vacuum chamber]]). These clouds consist of mostly hydrogen with about 23–28% helium and a few percent heavier elements. One example of such a star-forming [[nebula]] is the [[Orion Nebula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=P. R.

Once a region reaches a sufficient density of matter to satisfy the criteria for [[Jeans Instability]] it begins to collapse under its own gravitational force.\n\nAs the cloud collapses, individual [[Bok globule]]s form with up to 50 solar masses of material. As a globule collapses and the density increases, the gravitational energy is converted into heat and the temperature rises. When the protostellar cloud has approximately reached [[hydrostatic equilibrium]], a [[protostar]] forms at the core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Seligman | first = Courtney | url = http://courtneyseligman.com/text/stars/starevol2.htm | title = Slow Contraction of Protostellar Cloud | language = English | accessdate = 2006-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[pre-main sequence star]]s are often surrounded by a [[protoplanetary disk]].

In about 5 billion years, when the Sun is a red giant, it will be so large that it will consume [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus (planet)|Venus]]. Models predict that the Sun will expand out to about 99% of the distance to the Earth's present orbit (1 [[astronomical unit]], or AU).  By that time, however, the orbit of the Earth will expand to about 1.7 [[astronomical unit|AUs]] due to mass loss by the Sun and thus the Earth will escape envelopment.&lt;ref name=&quot;sun_future&quot;&gt;I.J.

In low mass stars (less than the 1.4 solar mass) the helium fusion process begins with an explosive burst of energy generation known as a [[helium flash]]. The energy resulting from this event is equivalent to the luminosity of 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; Suns, but it lasts only a few minutes. However, this energy goes into the elimination of the [[Electron degeneracy pressure|electron degeneracy]] at the core, and is not visible from the exterior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Alan C.

The core contracts until the temperature and pressure are sufficient to fuse [[carbon]]. This process continues, with the successive stages being fueled by [[oxygen]], [[neon]], [[silicon]], and [[sulfur]]. Near the end of the star's life, fusion can occur along a series of onion-layer shells within the star. Each shell burns a different element, with the outermost shell burning hydrogen; the next shell burning helium, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nmm.ac.uk/server/show/conWebDoc.299/ | title = What is a star? | publisher = Royal Greenwich Observatory | language = English | accessdate = 2006-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe final stage is reached when the star begins producing [[iron]]. Since iron nuclei are more [[binding energy|tightly bound]] than any heavier nuclei, if they are fused they do not release energy — the process would, on the contrary, consume energy. Likewise, since they are more tightly bound than all lighter nuclei, energy cannot be released by [[Nuclear fission|fission]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hinshaw&quot; /&gt; In relatively old, very massive stars, a large core of inert iron will accumulate in the center of the star. The heavier elements in these stars can work their way up to the surface, forming [[Wolf-Rayet star]]s with a dense stellar wind that sheds the outer atmosphere.\n\n===Collapse===\nAn average-size star (less than 1.4 solar masses after explosion) will then shed its outer layers as a [[planetary nebula]]. The core that remains will be a tiny ball of electron [[degenerate matter]] not massive enough for further compression to take place, supported only by [[Degenerate matter|degeneracy pressure]], called a [[white dwarf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=J.

This core will suddenly collapse as its electrons are driven into its protons, forming neutrons and neutrinos in a burst of inverse [[beta decay]], or [[electron capture]]. The [[shockwave]] formed by this sudden collapse causes the rest of the star to explode in a [[supernova]]. Supernovae are so bright that they may briefly outshine the star's entire home galaxy.

The balancing forces consist of inward directed gravitational force and the opposing pressure from the thermal energy of the plasma gas. For these forces to balance out, the temperature at the core of a typical star to be on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; °C or higher. The resulting temperature and pressure at the hydrogen-burning core of a main sequence star are sufficient for nuclear fusion to occur, and for sufficient energy to be produced to prevent further collapse of the star.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwarzschild&quot;&gt;{{cite book \n| first=Martin | last=Schwarzschild | title=Structure and Evolution of the Stars | publisher=Princeton University Press | year=1958 | id=ISBN 0-691-08044-5}}&lt;!-- Book republished by Dover as ISBN 0486614794, but ISBN in the cite book template is the one as published by Prin.

These photons interact with the surrounding plasma, adding to the thermal energy at the core. Stars on the main sequence convert hydrogen into helium, creating a slowly but steadily increasing proportion of helium in the core. Eventually the helium content becomes predominant and energy production ceases at the core. Instead fusion occurs in a slowly expanding shell around the degenerate helium core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://aether.lbl.gov/www/tour/elements/stellar/stellar_a.html | title = Formation of the High Mass Elements | publisher = Smoot Group | language = English\n| accessdate = 2006-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn addition to hydrostatic equilibrium, the interior of a stable star will also maintain an energy balance of thermal equilibrium. There is a radial temperature gradient throughout the interior that results in a flux of energy flowing toward the exterior. The outgoing flux of energy leaving a shell within the star will exactly match the incoming flux.\n\n[[Image:Sunlayers.gif|left|thumb|280px|The top half of this illustration shows a cut-away view of the Solar interior.

In this region the plasma will not be perturbed and any mass motions will die out. If this is not the case, however, then the plasma becomes unstable and convection will occur, forming a [[convection zone]]. This can occur, for example, in regions where very\nhigh energy fluxes occur, as near the core, or in areas with high [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]], as in the outer envelope.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwarzschild&quot; /&gt;\n\nThe occurrence of convection in the outer envelope of a main sequence star depends on the spectral type. Massive stars several times the mass of the Sun have a convection zone deep within the interior and a radiative zone in the outer layers. Smaller stars such as the Sun are just the opposite, with the convective zone located in the outer layers.&lt;ref name=&quot;imagine&quot;&gt;{{cite web | date = 2006-09-01 | url = http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l2/stars.html | title = What is a Star? | publisher = NASA | language = English | accessdate = 2006-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The convective zones will also vary over time as the star ages and the constitution of the interior is modified.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwarzschild&quot; /&gt;\n\nThe portion of a main sequence star that is visible to an observer is called the [[photosphere]]. This is the layer at which the plasma gas of the star becomes transparent to [[photon]]s of light. From here, the energy generated at the core becomes free to propagate out into space. It is within the photosphere that [[star spot]]s, or regions of lower than average temperature, appear.\n\nAbove the level of the photosphere is the [[stellar atmosphere]]. In a main sequence star such as the Sun, the lowest level of the atmosphere is the thin [[chromosphere]] region, where [[Spicule (solar physics)|spicule]]s appear and [[Solar flare|stellar flares]] begin. This is surrounded by a ''transition region'', where the temperature rapidly increases within a distance of only 100 km. Beyond this is the [[corona]], a volume of super-heated [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] that can extend outward to several million kilometres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | publisher=ESO | date=2001-08-01 | title=The Glory of a Nearby Star: Optical Light from a Hot Stellar Corona Detected with the VLT | url=http://www.eso.org/outreach/press-rel/pr-2001/pr-17-01.html | accessdate=2006-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of a corona appears to be dependent on a convective zone in the outer layers of the star.&lt;ref name=&quot;imagine&quot; /&gt;  Despite its high temperature, the corona emits very little light. The corona region of the Sun is normally only visible during a [[solar eclipse]]. \n\nFrom the corona, a [[solar wind|stellar wind]] of plasma particles expands outward from the star, propagating until it interacts with the interstellar medium.\n\n== Nuclear fusion reaction pathways ==\n{{main|Stellar nucleosynthesis}}\n{| style=&quot;float: right;&quot;\n[[Image:FusionintheSun.svg|200px|right|thumbnail|Overview of the proton-proton chain.]]\n|-\n[[Image:CNO Cycle.svg|200px|right|thumbnail|The carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycle.]]\n|}\nA variety of different nuclear fusion reactions take place inside the cores of stars, depending upon their mass and composition, as part of [[stellar nucleosynthesis]]. The net mass of the fused atomic nuclei is smaller than the sum of the constituents. This lost mass is converted into energy, according to the mass-energy relationship [[E=mc²]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sunshine&quot; /&gt;\n\nIn the Sun, with a 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; °K core, hydrogen fuses to form helium in the [[proton-proton chain reaction]]:&lt;ref name=&quot;synthesis&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = G.

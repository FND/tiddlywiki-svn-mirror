This is approximately 1000 times the distance from the Sun to [[Pluto (planet)|Pluto]] or roughly one [[light year]], almost a quarter of the distance from the Sun to [[Proxima Centauri]], the star nearest the Sun.\n\nThe Oort cloud would have its inner disk at the [[ecliptic]] from the [[Kuiper belt]]. Although no direct observations have been made of such a cloud, it is believed to be the source of most or all comets entering the inner [[solar system]] (some short-period comets may come from the Kuiper belt), based on observations of the [[orbit]]s of comets. \n\nIn [[1932]] [[Ernst Öpik]], an [[Estonia|Estonian]] astronomer, proposed&lt;ref&gt;Öpik, E., ''Note on Stellar Perturbations of Nearby Parabolic Orbits'', Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, '''67''', p. 169-182 (1932)&lt;/ref&gt; that comets originate in an orbiting cloud situated at the outermost edge of the solar system. In [[1950]] the idea was revived and proposed&lt;ref&gt;Oort, J. H., ''The structure of the cloud of comets surrounding the Solar System and a hypothesis concerning its origin'', Bull. Astron. Inst. Neth., ''11'', p. 91-110 (1950) [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1950BAN....11...91O&amp;amp;data_type=PDF_HIGH&amp;amp;type=PRINTER&amp;amp;filetype=.pdf  Text at Harvard server (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[the Netherlands|Dutch]] astronomer [[Jan Oort|Jan Hendrick Oort]] to explain an apparent contradiction: comets are destroyed by several passes through the inner solar system, yet if the comets we observe had really existed for billions of years (since the generally accepted origin of the solar system), all would have been destroyed by now. According to the hypothesis, the Oort cloud contains millions of comet nuclei, which are stable because the sun's radiation is very weak at their distance. The cloud provides a continual supply of new comets, replacing those that are destroyed. It is believed that if the Oort cloud exists and supplies comets, in order for it to supply the necessary volume of comets, the total mass of comets in the Oort cloud must be many times that of Earth.  Estimates range between five and one hundred (100) Earth masses.\n\nThe Oort cloud is thought to be a remnant of the original [[nebula]] that collapsed to [[Solar_system#age_and_origin_of_the_solar_system|form the Sun and planets five billion years ago]], and is loosely bound to the solar system. The most widely-accepted hypothesis of its formation is that the Oort cloud's objects initially formed much closer to the [[Sun]] as part of the same process that formed the [[planet]]s and [[asteroid]]s, but that gravitational interaction with young gas giants such as Jupiter ejected them into extremely long [[elliptical orbit|elliptical]] or [[parabolic orbit]]s. This process also served to scatter the objects out of the ecliptic plane, explaining the cloud's spherical distribution. While on the distant outer regions of these orbits, gravitational interaction with nearby stars further modified their orbits to make them more circular.\n\nIt is thought that other [[star]]s are likely to possess Oort clouds of their own, and that the outer edges of two nearby stars' Oort clouds may sometimes overlap, causing the occasional intrusion of a comet into the inner solar system.  The star with the greatest possibility of perturbing the Oort cloud in the next 10 million years is [[Gliese 710]].\n\n==Oort cloud objects==\n{{TNO}}\nSo far, only one potential Oort cloud object has been discovered; [[(90377) Sedna]]. With an orbit that ranges from roughly 76 to 928 AU, it is much closer than originally expected and may belong to an &quot;inner&quot; Oort cloud. If Sedna indeed belongs to the Oort cloud, this may mean that the Oort cloud is both denser and closer to the Sun than previously thought. This has been proposed as possible evidence that the Sun initially formed as part of a dense cluster of stars{{citation needed}}; with closer neighbors during Oort cloud formation, objects ejected by gas giants would have their orbits circularized closer to the Sun than was predicted for situations with more distant neighbors. It is worth noting that, in certain scientific circles, [[(90377) Sedna]] is considered to be simply a [[Trans-Neptunian object]]. This is because its orbit doesn't carry it completely out to the assumed position of the Oort Cloud, and its orbit is too far out for it to be truly considered as a [[Kuiper Belt]] object.\n\n&lt;!-- &lt;br style=&quot;clear: both&quot;&gt; --&gt;\n\n&lt;table border=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;caption&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Oort cloud objects'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;\n\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Number&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Equatorial diameter&lt;br&gt;(km)&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;[[Apsis|Perihelion]] (in AU)&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;[[Apsis|Aphelion]] (in AU)&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Date discovered&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Discoverer&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Diameter method&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;90377&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;[[90377 Sedna|Sedna]]&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;1800, &amp;gt;1180&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;76 (±7)&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;975&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;[[2003]]&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;[[Michael E.

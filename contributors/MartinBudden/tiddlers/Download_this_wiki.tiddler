<pre>You can save a complete copy of this site as a TiddlyWiki on your local drive by right clicking on [[this link|index.html]]
and selecting //Save link as...// or //Save target as...//. You can choose where to save the file, and what to call it (but make sure that it's saved in HTML format and with an HTML extension).

@@There can be confusing and subtle differences between different browsers. Some points to watch:@@
* If you're using Windows XP Service Pack 2 or Windows Vista, check for known [[ServicePack2Problems|http://www.tiddlywiki.com/#ServicePack2Problems]] and [[VistaIssues|http://www.tiddlywiki.com/#VistaIssues]]
* Do ''not'' use the File/Save command in your browser to save TiddlyWiki, because of [[SaveUnpredictabilities|http://www.tiddlywiki.com/#SaveUnpredictabilities]].
* Make sure that you're saving in HTML (or "page source" format), not one of the new-fangled archive formats

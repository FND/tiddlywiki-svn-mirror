<div title="testPmWikiFormat" modifier="MartinBudden" created="200609030000" tags="test" wikiformat="PmWiki">
<pre>This page provides a test of some of the markup sequences available in PmWiki.

----

!! Paragraphs

To create paragraphs, simply enter text. Use a blank line to start a new paragraph.

Words on two lines in a row will wrap and fill as needed (the normal XHTML behavior).

* Use [@\@] (single backslash) at the end of a line to join the current line to the next one.
* Use [@\\@] (two backslashes) at the end of a line to force a line break.
* Use [@\\\@] (three backslashes) at the end of a line to force 2 line breaks.
* Use [@[[&lt;&lt;]]@] to force a line break that will clear floating elements.


!! Indented Paragraphs ''(Quotes)''

Arrows ([@-&gt;@]) at the beginning of a paragraph can be used to produce an indented paragraph. More hyphens at the beginning ([@---&gt;@]) produce larger indents.

(:markup:)
-&gt;Four score and seven years ago our fathers placed upon this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
(:markupend:)

Inverted Arrows ([@-&lt;@]) at the beginning of a paragraph can be used to produce a paragraph with a hanging indent. Adding hyphens at the beginning ([@---&lt;@]) causes all the text to indent.

(:markup:)
-&lt;Four score and seven years ago our fathers placed upon this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. 
(:markupend:)

(:markup:)
--&lt;Four score and seven years ago our fathers placed upon this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. And that food would be good to.
(:markupend:)


!! Bulleted and Numbered Lists

Bullet lists are made by placing asterisks at the left margin. Numbered lists are made by placing number-signs (#) at the left margin. More asterisks/number-signs increases the level of bullet:

(:markup:) 
* First-level list item
** Second-level list item
### Order this
#### And this (optional)
### Then this
** Another second-level item
* A first-level item: cooking
## Prepare the experiment
### Unwrap the pop-tart
### Insert the pop-tart into the toaster
## Begin cooking the pop tart
## Stand back
(:markupend:)


!! Horizontal Line

Four or more dashes ([=----=]) at the beginning of a line produce a horizontal line.

----


!! Emphasis

* Enclose text in doubled single-quotes ([=''text''=]), i.e., ''two apostrophes'', for emphasis (usually ''italics'')
* Enclose text in tripled single-quotes ([='''text'''=]), i.e. ''three apostrophes'', for strong emphasis (usually '''bold''')
* Enclose text in five single-quotes ([='''''text'''''=]), or triples within doubles (''five apostrophes''), for some other kind of emphasis (usually '''''bold italics''''')
* Enclose text in doubled at-signs ([=@@text@@=]) for @@monospace@@ text
* Use [=[+large+]=] for [+large+] text, [=[++larger++]=] for [++larger++], [=[-small-]=] for [-small-] text, and [=[--smaller--]=] for [--smaller--].
* Emphasis can be used multiple times within a line, but cannot span across markup line boundaries (i.e., you can't put a paragraph break in the middle of bold text).

Other styling 
(:markup:)
'+big+', '-small-', '^super^', '_sub_', 

{+insert or underscore+}, 

{-delete or strikethrough or strikeout-}
(:markupend:)
* [@`WikiWord@] `WikiWord neutralisation


!! References

* Use words and phrases in double brackets (e.g., [=[[text formatting rules]]=]) to create links to other pages on this wiki.
* Capitalized words joined together (e.g., [[WikiWord]]s) can also be used to make references to other pages without needing the double-brackets.
* Precede [=URLs=] with &quot;@@http:@@&quot;, &quot;@@ftp:@@&quot;, or &quot;@@mailto:@@&quot; to create links automatically, as in http://www.pmichaud.com/toast.
* '''NOT DONE YET:''' [=URLs=] ending with @@.gif@@, @@.jpg@@, or @@.png@@ are displayed as images in the page
* '''NOT DONE YET:''' Links with arbitrary text can be created as either [=[[=]''target'' | ''text'']] or [=[[=]''text'' -&gt; ''target''[=]]=]. ''Text'' can be an image URL, in which case the image becomes the link to the remote ''url'' or ''[[WikiWord]]''.
* '''NOT DONE YET:''' [[#Anchors]] Anchor targets within pages (#-links) can be created using @@[=[[#target]]=]@@.


!! Headings

Headings are made by placing an exclamation mark ('''!''') at the left margin. More exclamation marks increase the level of heading. For example,

(:markup:)
! Level 1 Heading
!! Level 2 Heading
!!! Level 3 Heading
!!!! Level 4 Heading
(:markupend:)


!! Escape sequence

Anything placed between [=[= and =]=] is not interpreted by PmWiki. This makes it possible to turn off special formatting interpretations and neutralise [=WikiWords=] that are not links (even easier is to use a tick ` in front, like [=`WikiWord=]).

For preformatted text blocks, use the [=[@...@]=] markup. 

(:markup:)
[@
Code goes here like [[PmWiki.PmWiki]]
'$CurrentTime $[by] $AuthorLink: [=$ChangeSummary=]'; #just some code
@]
(:markupend:)

!! Tables

Tables are defined by enclosing cells with '||'. A cell with leading and trailing spaces is centered; a cell with leading spaces is right-aligned; all other cells are left-aligned. An empty cell will cause the previous cell to span multiple columns. (There is currently no mechanism for spanning multiple rows.) A '!' as the first character in a cell provides emphasis that can be used to provide headings.

'''NOT DONE YET:''' A line beginning with '||' specifies the table attributes for subsequent tables.
(:markup:)

||border=1 width=50%
||!Table||!Heading||!Example||
||!Left || Center || Right||
||A ||! a B || C||
|| || single || ||
|| || multi span ||||
(:markupend:)</pre>

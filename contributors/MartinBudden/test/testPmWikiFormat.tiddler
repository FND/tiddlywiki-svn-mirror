<div tiddler="testPmWikiFormat" modifier="MartinBudden" created="200609030000" tags="test" wikiformat="PmWiki">This page provides a test of some of the markup sequences available in PmWiki.\n\n----\n\n!! Paragraphs\n\nTo create paragraphs, simply enter text. Use a blank line to start a new paragraph.\n\nWords on two lines in a row will wrap and fill as needed (the normal XHTML behavior).\n\n* Use [@\s@] (single backslash) at the end of a line to join the current line to the next one.\n* Use [@\s\s@] (two backslashes) at the end of a line to force a line break.\n* Use [@\s\s\s@] (three backslashes) at the end of a line to force 2 line breaks.\n* Use [@[[&lt;&lt;]]@] to force a line break that will clear floating elements.\n\n\n!! Indented Paragraphs ''(Quotes)''\n\nArrows ([@-&gt;@]) at the beginning of a paragraph can be used to produce an indented paragraph. More hyphens at the beginning ([@---&gt;@]) produce larger indents.\n\n(:markup:)\n-&gt;Four score and seven years ago our fathers placed upon this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\n(:markupend:)\n\nInverted Arrows ([@-&lt;@]) at the beginning of a paragraph can be used to produce a paragraph with a hanging indent. Adding hyphens at the beginning ([@---&lt;@]) causes all the text to indent.\n\n(:markup:)\n-&lt;Four score and seven years ago our fathers placed upon this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. \n(:markupend:)\n\n(:markup:)\n--&lt;Four score and seven years ago our fathers placed upon this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. And that food would be good to.\n(:markupend:)\n\n\n!! Bulleted and Numbered Lists\n\nBullet lists are made by placing asterisks at the left margin. Numbered lists are made by placing number-signs (#) at the left margin. More asterisks/number-signs increases the level of bullet:\n\n(:markup:) \n* First-level list item\n** Second-level list item\n### Order this\n#### And this (optional)\n### Then this\n** Another second-level item\n* A first-level item: cooking\n## Prepare the experiment\n### Unwrap the pop-tart\n### Insert the pop-tart into the toaster\n## Begin cooking the pop tart\n## Stand back\n(:markupend:)\n\n\n!! Horizontal Line\n\nFour or more dashes ([=----=]) at the beginning of a line produce a horizontal line.\n\n----\n\n\n!! Emphasis\n\n* Enclose text in doubled single-quotes ([=''text''=]), i.e., ''two apostrophes'', for emphasis (usually ''italics'')\n* Enclose text in tripled single-quotes ([='''text'''=]), i.e. ''three apostrophes'', for strong emphasis (usually '''bold''')\n* Enclose text in five single-quotes ([='''''text'''''=]), or triples within doubles (''five apostrophes''), for some other kind of emphasis (usually '''''bold italics''''')\n* Enclose text in doubled at-signs ([=@@text@@=]) for @@monospace@@ text\n* Use [=[+large+]=] for [+large+] text, [=[++larger++]=] for [++larger++], [=[-small-]=] for [-small-] text, and [=[--smaller--]=] for [--smaller--].\n* Emphasis can be used multiple times within a line, but cannot span across markup line boundaries (i.e., you can't put a paragraph break in the middle of bold text).\n\nOther styling \n(:markup:)\n'+big+', '-small-', '^super^', '_sub_', \n\n{+insert or underscore+}, \n\n{-delete or strikethrough or strikeout-}\n(:markupend:)\n* [@`WikiWord@] `WikiWord neutralisation\n\n\n!! References\n\n* Use words and phrases in double brackets (e.g., [=[[text formatting rules]]=]) to create links to other pages on this wiki.\n* Capitalized words joined together (e.g., [[WikiWord]]s) can also be used to make references to other pages without needing the double-brackets.\n* Precede [=URLs=] with &quot;@@http:@@&quot;, &quot;@@ftp:@@&quot;, or &quot;@@mailto:@@&quot; to create links automatically, as in http://www.pmichaud.com/toast.\n* '''NOT DONE YET:''' [=URLs=] ending with @@.gif@@, @@.jpg@@, or @@.png@@ are displayed as images in the page\n* '''NOT DONE YET:''' Links with arbitrary text can be created as either [=[[=]''target'' | ''text'']] or [=[[=]''text'' -&gt; ''target''[=]]=]. ''Text'' can be an image URL, in which case the image becomes the link to the remote ''url'' or ''[[WikiWord]]''.\n* '''NOT DONE YET:''' [[#Anchors]] Anchor targets within pages (#-links) can be created using @@[=[[#target]]=]@@.\n\n\n!! Headings\n\nHeadings are made by placing an exclamation mark ('''!''') at the left margin. More exclamation marks increase the level of heading. For example,\n\n(:markup:)\n! Level 1 Heading\n!! Level 2 Heading\n!!! Level 3 Heading\n!!!! Level 4 Heading\n(:markupend:)\n\n\n!! Escape sequence\n\nAnything placed between [=[= and =]=] is not interpreted by PmWiki. This makes it possible to turn off special formatting interpretations and neutralise [=WikiWords=] that are not links (even easier is to use a tick ` in front, like [=`WikiWord=]).\n\nFor preformatted text blocks, use the [=[@...@]=] markup. \n\n(:markup:)\n[@\nCode goes here like [[PmWiki.PmWiki]]\n'$CurrentTime $[by] $AuthorLink: [=$ChangeSummary=]'; #just some code\n@]\n(:markupend:)\n\n!! Tables\n\nTables are defined by enclosing cells with '||'. A cell with leading and trailing spaces is centered; a cell with leading spaces is right-aligned; all other cells are left-aligned. An empty cell will cause the previous cell to span multiple columns. (There is currently no mechanism for spanning multiple rows.) A '!' as the first character in a cell provides emphasis that can be used to provide headings.\n\n'''NOT DONE YET:''' A line beginning with '||' specifies the table attributes for subsequent tables.\n(:markup:)\n\n||border=1 width=50%\n||!Table||!Heading||!Example||\n||!Left || Center || Right||\n||A ||! a B || C||\n|| || single || ||\n|| || multi span ||||\n(:markupend:)\n</div>

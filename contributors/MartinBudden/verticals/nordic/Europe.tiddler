'''Europe''' is one of the seven traditional [[continents]] of the [[Earth]]. [[Physical geography|Physically]] and [[geology|geologically]], Europe is the westernmost [[peninsula]] of [[Eurasia]], west of [[Asia]].  Europe is bounded to the north by the [[Arctic Ocean]], to the west by the [[Atlantic Ocean]], to the south by the [[Mediterranean Sea]], and to the southeast by the waterways adjoining the Mediterranean to and including the [[Black Sea]] and the [[Caucasus Mountains]].  On the east, Europe is divided from Asia by the [[water divide]] of the [[Ural Mountains]] and by the [[Caspian Sea]].

Europe is the world's second-smallest continent in terms of [[area]], covering about 10,400,000&amp;nbsp;[[square kilometre]]s (4,010,000 [[square mile|sq mi]]) or 2.0% of the [[Earth]]'s surface. The only continent smaller than Europe is [[Australia (continent)|Australia]]. In terms of [[population]], it is the third-largest continent (after Asia and [[Africa]]) with a population of some 710,000,000 or about 11% of the world's population. However, the term ''continent'' can refer to a [[human geography|cultural and political]] distinction or a [[physical geography|physiographic]] one, leading to various perspectives about Europe's precise borders, area, and population.

The [[European Union]] – comprising 25 member [[state]]s, with two  countries acceding in 2007 ([[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]]) &lt;ref&gt;[[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]] will accede to the European Union on 1 January 2007, bringing the total number of member states to 27.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and 3 candidates in accession negotiations ([[Republic of Macedonia]],[[Turkey]] and [[Croatia]]) – is the largest political and economic entity covering the European continent, while [[Russia]] (excluding portions in Asia) is the second largest entity and Europe's largest state in area and population. The European Union also featured the world's largest economy with an estimated nominal GDP of 13.4 trillion USD,&lt;ref name=&quot;EU GDP, World Monetary Fund&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2006/01/data/dbcoutm.cfm?SD=2005&amp;ED=2005&amp;R1=1&amp;R2=1&amp;CS=3&amp;SS=2&amp;OS=C&amp;DD=0&amp;OUT=1&amp;C=512-941-914-446-612-666-614-672-311-946-213-137-911-962-193-674-122-676-912-548-313-556-419-678-513-181-316-682-913-684-124-273-339-921-638-948-514-686-218-688-963-518-616-728-223-558-516-138-918-353-748-196-618-278-522-692-622-694-156-142-624-449-626-564-628-283-228-853-924-288-233-293-632-566-636-964-634-182-238-453-662-968-960-922-423-714-935-862-128-716-611-456-321-722-243-965-248-718-469-724-253-576-642-936-643-961-939-813-644-199-819-184-172-524-132-361-646-362-648-364-915-732-134-366-652-734-174-144-328-146-258-463-656-528-654-923-336-738-263-578-268-537-532-742-944-866-176-369-534-744-536-186-429-925-178-746-436-926-136-466-343-112-158-111-439-298-916-927-664-846-826-299-542-582-443-474-917-754-544-698&amp;S=NGDPD&amp;CMP=0&amp;x=31&amp;y=8|title=EU GDP, World Monetary Fund|accessdate=2006-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the nominal GDP per capita ranging from $66,463 in [[Luxembourg]] to about $5,951 in [[Latvia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nominal GDP per capita, World Bank 2004&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmaster.com/red/graph/eco_gdp_percap-economy-gdp-nominal-per-capita&amp;nofb=1|title=Nominal GDP per capita, World Bank 2004|accessdate=2006-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
{{wiktionary|Europe}}
In [[Greek mythology]], [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]] was a [[Phoenicia]]n princess who was abducted by [[Zeus]] in bull form and taken to the island of [[Crete]], where she gave birth to [[Minos]]. For [[Homer]], '''Europe''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{polytonic|Εὐρώπη}} ''{{Unicode|Eurṓpē}}''; see also [[List of traditional Greek place names]]) was a mythological queen of Crete, not a geographical designation. Later ''Europa'' stood for [[Geography of Greece|mainland Greece]], and by [[500 BC]] its meaning had been extended to lands to the north.

In etymology one theory suggests the name ''Europe'' is derived from the Greek words meaning broad (''eurys'') and face (''ops'') &amp;ndash; ''broad'' having been an [[epithet]] of [[Earth]] herself in the reconstructed [[Proto-Indo-European religion]]; see [[Prithvi]] (''Plataia''). A minority, however, suggest this Greek [[popular etymology]] is really based on a [[Semitic]] word such as the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''erebu'' meaning &quot;sunset&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Etymonline: European&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=European| title=Etymonline: European| accessdate=2006-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also ''[[Erebus]]''). From the [[Middle East]]ern vantagepoint, the sun does set over Europe, the lands to the west. Likewise, [[Asia]] is sometimes thought to have derived from a Semitic word such as the Akkadian ''asu'', meaning &quot;sunrise&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Etymonline: Asia&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Asia| title=Etymonline: Asia| accessdate=2006-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the land to the east from a Middle Eastern perspective.

The majority of major world languages use words derived from &quot;Europa&quot; to refer to the continent &amp;ndash; e.g. Chinese uses the word ''{{Unicode|Ōuzhōu}}'' (歐洲), which is an abbreviation of the transliterated name ''{{Unicode|Ōuluóbā zhōu}}'' (歐羅巴洲).

==History==
{{main|History of Europe}}

The origins of Western [[democracy|democratic]] and [[individualism|individualistic]] [[culture]] are often attributed to [[Ancient Greece]], though numerous other distinct influences, in particular [[Christianity]], can also be credited with the spread of concepts such as [[egalitarianism]] and [[rule of law|universality of law]].

After the [[decline of the Roman Empire]], Europe entered a long period of changes arising from what is known as the [[Age of Migrations]]. That period has been known as the &quot;[[Dark Ages]]&quot; to [[Renaissance]] thinkers. Isolated monastic communities in [[Ireland]] and elsewhere carefully safeguarded and compiled written knowledge accumulated previously.

During this time, the western part of the Roman Empire was &quot;reborn&quot; as the [[Holy Roman Empire]], later called [[Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation]]. The eastern part of the Roman Empire became known in the west as the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The 'Byzantines' themselves still called themselves {{polytonic|Βασιλεία τῶν Ῥωμαίων}} ''Basileia tōn Romaiōn'' - the Empire of the Romans. In 1453, when the [[Ottoman Empire]] conquered the Byzantine capital [[Constantinople]], the Byzantine Empire ceased to exist, with a small hold out state of [[Empire of Trebizond|Trebizond]] which lasted until 1461.

The [[Renaissance]] and the [[New Monarchs]] marked the start of a period of discovery, exploration, and increase in scientific knowledge. In the 15th century, [[Portugal]] opened the age of discoveries, soon followed by [[Spain]]. They were later joined by [[France]], the [[Netherlands]] and the [[United Kingdom]] in building large colonial empires with vast holdings in [[Africa]], [[the Americas]], and [[Asia]].

After the age of discovery, the ideas of [[democracy]] took hold in Europe. Struggles for independence arose, most notably in [[France]] during the period known as the [[French Revolution]]. This led to vast upheaval in Europe as these revolutionary ideas propagated across the continent. The rise of democracy led to increased tension within Europe on top of the tension already existing due to competition within the [[New World]]. The most famous of these conflicts happened when [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] rose to power and set out on a conquest, forming a new [[First French Empire|French Empire]], which soon collapsed. After these conquests Europe stabilised, but the old foundations were already beginning to crumble.

The [[Industrial Revolution]] started in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] in the late [[18th century]], leading to a move away from agriculture, much greater general prosperity and a corresponding increase in population. Many of the states in Europe took their present form in the [[aftermath of World War I#Geopolitical and Economic Consequences|aftermath of World War I]]. From the end of [[World War II]] through the end of the [[Cold War]], Europe was divided into two major political and economic blocks: [[Communism|Communist]] nations in [[Eastern Europe]]  and [[Capitalist]] countries in [[Southern Europe]], [[Northern Europe]] and [[Western Europe]]. About 1990, with the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], the wider [[Iron Curtain]], and the [[Soviet Union]] the [[Eastern Block]] disintegrated.

[[European integration]] has been a theme in European relations since the end of the second World War, and has accelerated since the end of the [[Cold War]]. The [[European Union]], the successor to the [[European Community]], has enlarged from 6 original founding members to 27 today.  The potential admission of [[Turkey]] is contentious, as it involves a transcontinental country with a predominantly [[Muslim]] population.  Turkey is also in dispute with an existing member, [[Greece]], over the future of [[Cyprus]].  Negotiations are therefore expected to be lengthy.  The European Union has developed from a trade-oriented organisation into one resembling a confederation in a number of respects. European membership of [[NATO]] has also increased since the end of the Cold War, with the admission of number of Eastern European countries.

[[Physical geography|Physiographically]], Europe is the northwestern constituent of the larger landmass known as [[Eurasia]], or [[Africa-Eurasia]]: [[Asia]] occupies the eastern bulk of this continuous landmass (save the [[Suez Canal]] separating Asia and [[Africa]]) and all share a common [[continental shelf]].  Europe's eastern frontier is now commonly delineated by the [[Ural Mountains]] in [[Russia]] ([[Strabo]], ''Geography'' 11.1, took the [[Tanais River]] to be the boundary, as did early Judaic sources).  The south-east boundary with Asia is not universally defined. Most commonly the [[Ural River|Ural]] or, alternatively, the [[Emba River|Emba]] River serve as possible boundaries. The boundary continues to the [[Caspian Sea]], the crest of the [[Caucasus Mountains]] or, alternatively, the [[Kura River]] in the [[Caucasus]], and on to the [[Black Sea]]; the [[Bosporus]], the [[Sea of Marmara]], and the [[Dardanelles]] conclude the Asian boundary. However, numerous geographers consider [[Azerbaijan]]'s and [[Armenia]]'s southern border with [[Iran]] and [[Turkey]]'s southern and eastern border with [[Syria]], [[Iraq]] and [[Iran]] as the boundary between [[Asia]] and Europe because of political and cultural reasons. The [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the south separates Europe from [[Africa]]. The western boundary is the [[Atlantic Ocean]]; [[Iceland]], though nearer to [[Greenland]] ([[North America]]) than mainland Europe, is generally included in Europe. There is ongoing debate on where the [[geographical centre of Europe]] is. ''For detailed description of the boundary between Asia and Europe [[Transcontinental nation|see here]].''

Due to sociopolitical and cultural differences, there are various descriptions of Europe's boundary; in some sources, some territories are not included in Europe, while other sources include them.  For instance, geographers from [[Post-Soviet states|Russia and other post-Soviet states]] generally include the Urals in Europe while including Caucasia in Asia.

In another usage, ''Europe'' is increasingly being used as a short-form for the [[European Union]] (EU) and its members, currently consisting of 25 member states and the candidate countries negotiating for membership, and several other countries expected to begin negotiations in the future (see [[Enlargement of the European Union]]). This definition, however, excludes non-members such as [[Switzerland]], [[Norway]] and [[Russia]].

=== Physical geography ===

Land relief in Europe shows great variation within relatively small areas. The southern regions, however, are more mountainous, while moving north the terrain descends from the high [[Alps]], [[Pyrenees]] and [[Carpathians]], through hilly uplands, into broad, low northern plains, which are vast in the east. This extended lowland is known as the Great European Plain, and at its heart lies the [[North German Plain]]. An arc of uplands also exists along the north-western seaboard, beginning in the western [[British Isles]] and continuing along the mountainous, [[fjord]]-cut spine of [[Norway]].

This description is simplified. Sub-regions such as Iberia and Italy contain their own complex features, as does mainland Europe itself, where the relief contains many plateaus, river valleys and basins that complicate the general trend. [[Iceland]] and the [[British Isles]] are special cases. The former is a land unto itself in the northern ocean which is counted as part of Europe, while the latter are upland areas that were once joined to the mainland until rising sea levels cut them off.

== Biodiversity ==
&lt;!-- Probably this should be transferred to a new article named &quot;Biodiversity of Europe&quot; and only the summary should be left here. Specific species should be added. --&gt;

Having lived side-by-side with agricultural peoples for millennia, Europe's animals and plants have been profoundly affected by the presence and activities of man. With the exception of [[Scandinavia]] and northern [[Russia]], few areas of untouched wilderness are currently found in Europe, except for various national parks.

The main natural vegetation cover in Europe is [[forest]]. The conditions for growth are very favourable. In the north, the [[Gulf Stream]] and [[North Atlantic Drift]] warm the continent. Southern Europe could be described as having a warm, but mild climate. There are frequent summer droughts in this region. Mountain ridges also affect the conditions. Some of these ([[Alps]], [[Pyrenees]]) are oriented east-west and allow the wind to carry large masses of water from the ocean in the interior. Others are oriented south-north ([[Scandinavian Mountains]], [[Dinaric Alps|Dinarides]], [[Carpathians]], [[Apennines]]) and because the rain falls primarily on the side of mountains that is oriented towards sea, forests grow well on this side, while on the other side, the conditions are much less favourable. Few corners of mainland Europe have not been grazed by [[livestock]] at some point in time, and the cutting down of the pre-agricultural forest habitat caused disruption to the original plant and animal ecosystems.

Eighty to ninety per cent of Europe was once covered by forest. It stretched from the Mediterranean Sea to the [[Arctic Ocean]]. Though over half of Europe's original forests disappeared through the centuries of [[deforestation]], Europe still has over one quarter of its land area as forest, such as the [[taiga]] of Scandinavia and Russia, mixed [[rainforest]]s of the Caucasus and the [[Cork oak]] forests in the western Mediterranean. During recent times, deforestation has been slowed and many trees have been planted. However, in many cases monoculture [[plantation]]s of [[Pinophyta|conifers]] have replaced the original mixed natural forest, because these grow quicker. The plantations now cover vast areas of land, but offer poorer habitats for many European forest dwelling species which require a mixture of tree species and diverse forest structure. The amount of natural forest in Western Europe is just 2&amp;ndash;3% or less, in European Russia 5&amp;ndash;10%. The country with the smallest percentage of forested area (excluding the micronations) is the [[Republic of Ireland]] (8%), while the most forested country is [[Finland]] (72%).
[[Image:Poland Bialowieza - BPN.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Białowieża National Park]], Poland]]
In temperate Europe, mixed forest with both [[flowering plant|broadleaf]] and [[pinophyta|coniferous]] trees dominate. The most important species in central and western Europe are [[beech]] and [[oak]]. In the north, the taiga is a mixed [[spruce]]-[[pine]]-[[birch]] forest; further north within Russia and extreme northern Scandinavia, the taiga gives way to [[tundra]] as the Arctic is approached. In the Mediterranean, many [[olive]] trees have been planted, which are very well adapted to its arid climate; [[Cupressus sempervirens|Mediterranean Cypress]] is also widely planted in southern Europe. The semi-arid Mediterranean region hosts much scrub forest. A narrow east-west tongue of Eurasian [[grassland]] (the [[steppe]]) extends eastwards from Ukraine and southern Russia and ends in Hungary and traverses into taiga to the north.

Glaciation during the most recent [[ice age]] and the presence of man affected the distribution of European fauna. As for the animals, in many parts of Europe most large animals and top [[predator]] species have been hunted to extinction. The [[woolly mammoth]] and [[aurochs]] were extinct before the end of the [[Neolithic]] period. Today [[wolf|wolves]] ([[carnivore]]s) and [[bears]] ([[omnivore]]s) are endangered. Once they were found in most parts of Europe. However, deforestation caused these animals to withdraw further and further. By the [[Middle Ages]] the bears' habitats were limited to more or less inaccessible mountains with sufficient forest cover.[[Image:Praia do Tamariz - Estoril.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Tamariz beach - [[Portugal]]]] Today, the brown bear lives primarily in the Balkan peninsula, Scandinavia, and Russia; a small number also persist in other countries across Europe (Austria, Pyrenees etc.), but in these areas brown bear populations are fragmented and marginalised because of the destruction of their habitat. In addition, [[polar bear]]s may be found on [[Svalbard]], an autonomous [[Norway|Norwegian]] island region far north of Scandinavia. The wolf, the second largest predator in Europe after the brown bear, can be found primarily in [[Eastern Europe]] and in the Balkans, with a handful of packs in Spain and Scandinavia.

Other important European carnivores are [[Eurasian lynx]], European [[wild cat]], [[fox]]es (especially the [[red fox]]), [[jackal]] and different species of [[marten]]s, [[hedgehog]]s, different species of snakes ([[viper]]s, [[grass snake]]...), different birds ([[owl]]s, [[hawk]]s and other [[birds of prey]]).

Important European [[herbivore]]s are [[snail]]s, [[amphibian]] [[Larva|larvae]], [[fish]], different birds, and [[mammal]]s, like [[rodent]]s, [[deer]] and [[roe deer]], [[boar]]s, and living in the mountains, [[marmot]]s, [[Alpine Ibex|steinbocks]], [[chamois]] among others.

Sea creatures are also an important part of European flora and fauna. The sea flora is mainly [[phytoplankton]]. Important animals that live in European seas are [[zooplankton]], [[mollusc]]s, [[echinoderm]]s, different [[crustacean]]s, [[squid]]s and [[octopuses]], fish, [[dolphin]]s, and [[whales]].

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Europe}}

[[Image:Europe population growth 2006.png|thumb|The population growth/decline of European countries]]

Since the [[Renaissance]], Europe has had a dominating influence in culture, economics and social movements in the world. European demographics are important not only historically, but also in understanding current international relations and population issues.

Some current and past issues in European demographics have included [[Emigration|religious emigration]], [[race relations]], [[Immigration#Why do people immigrate.3F|economic immigration]], a declining [[birth rate]] and an [[ageing population]]. In some countries, such as the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Poland]], access to [[abortion]] is currently limited; in the past, such restrictions and also restrictions on artificial birth control were commonplace throughout Europe. Furthermore, two European countries (currently [[The Netherlands]] and [[Switzerland]]) have allowed a limited form of [[voluntary euthanasia]]. It remains to be seen how much demographic impact this may have.

In 2005, the '''population of Europe''' was estimated to be 728 million according to the [[United Nations]], which is slightly more than one-ninth of the [[world]]'s population. A century ago, Europe had nearly a quarter of the world's population. The population of Europe has grown in the past century, but in other areas of the world (in particular [[Africa]] and [[Asia]]) the population has grown far more quickly.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNPP 2004&quot;&gt;[http://esa.un.org/unpp UNPP, 2004 Revision World Population Prospects: The 2004 Revision Population Database]. [[United Nations]] Population Division, 2005.  Last accessed October 25, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; According to UN population projection (medium variant), Europe's share will fall to 7% in 2050, numbering 653 million. &lt;ref&gt;http://esa.un.org/unpp/p2k0data.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Languages of Europe}}

: ''See also: [[Eurolinguistics]]''

There are several linguistic groups widely recognised in Europe. These sometimes (but not always) coincide with cultural and historical connections between the various nations, though in other cases religion is considered a more significant distinguishing factor.

=== Romance languages ===
{{main|Latin Europe}}

[[Romance languages]] are spoken more or less in south-western Europe, as well as [[Romania]] and [[Moldova]] which are situated in [[Eastern Europe]]. This area consists of: [[Italy]], [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[France]], [[Romania]], [[Moldova]], French-speaking [[Belgium]] ([[Wallonia]], [[Brussels]]), [[French language|French]]-speaking Switzerland ([[Romandy]]), [[Romansh]]-speaking Switzerland, and [[Italian language|Italian]]-speaking Switzerland.  All Romance languages are derived from the Roman language, [[Latin]].

=== Germanic languages ===
{{main|Germanic Europe}}

[[Germanic languages]] are spoken more or less in north-western Europe and some parts of [[central Europe]]. This region consists of:  [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Germany]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Denmark]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Austria]], [[Liechtenstein]], most of [[Switzerland]],   [[Iceland]],  [[Flanders]] and the German-speaking areas of [[Wallonia]], the [[Faroe Islands]], [[Luxembourg]],  the [[Finland Swedish|Swedish-speaking]] [[municipalities of Finland|municipalities]] of Finland, and [[South Tyrol]] in Italy.

=== Slavic languages ===
{{main|Slavic Europe}}

[[Slavic languages]] are spoken in Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe. This area consists of: [[Belarus]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Free State of Saxony|Saxony]]   and [[Brandenburg]] in [[Germany]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]] and [[Ukraine]].

* '''Cyrillic Alphabet'''

The [[Cyrillic alphabet]] is named after [[St Cyril]], a missionary from Byzantium. It was invented in the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] sometime during the 10th century AD, possibly by [[St Kliment of Ohrid]], to write the [[Old Church Slavonic language]]. The Cyrillic alphabet achieved its current form in 1708 during the reign of [[Peter the Great]]. Four letters were eliminated from the alphabet in a 1917/18 reform.

The Cyrillic alphabet has been adapted to write over 50 different languages, mainly in Russia, Central Asia and part of Eastern Europe. In many cases additional letters are used, some of which are adaptations of standard Cyrillic letters, while others are taken from the Greek or Latin alphabets.

=== Uralic languages ===

The [[Uralic languages]] are divided into three main groups, two of which have representatives in Europe. The [[Finno-Permic languages]] are spoken in [[Finland]], [[Estonia]], and parts of [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], [[Latvia]], and European [[Russia]] while the [[Ugric languages]] are spoken in [[Hungary]] and parts of [[Romania]], [[Slovakia]], [[Serbia]], [[Ukraine]], and Siberian Russia. These two groups comprise the [[Finno-Ugric languages|Finno-Ugric]] branch of the Uralic language family.

=== Altaic languages ===

[[Turkic languages]] are spoken in [[Turkey]], [[Azerbaijan]], the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] (recognised only by Turkey), parts of [[Bulgaria]], parts of [[Greece]], parts of [[Romania]], parts of [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], parts of [[Moldova]], parts of [[Russia]], parts of [[Ukraine]], parts of the [[Caucasus]] and in Turkish diaspora communities in several other European countries (most notably [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Belgium]], and the [[Netherlands]]).

The [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic]] branch of the Altaic phylum is represented in Europe by the [[Kalmyk language]], which is spoken by the [[Kalmyk people]] in [[Kalmykia]], a constituent republic of the [[Russian Federation]].

=== Baltic languages ===

[[Baltic languages]] are spoken in [[Lithuania]] and [[Latvia]]. ([[Estonia]]'s national language is part of the [[Finno-Ugric languages|Finno-Ugric]] family even though it is a [[Baltic state]] geographically.)

=== Celtic languages ===
{{main|Celtic Europe}}

&quot;[[Celtic languages|Celtic language]]&quot; was originally used only to describe the [[Irish language|Gaelic]] language in [[Ireland]]; however, the term now extends to the other [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] and [[Brythonic languages]]. [[Celtic Europe]] is comprised of those countries and regions where [[Celtic languages]] are spoken. The [[Celtic nations]] are: [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]] (UK), [[Wales]] (UK), [[Cornwall]] (UK), the [[Isle of Man]] (a [[Crown Dependency|British Crown dependency]]) and [[Brittany]] (within [[France]]). These are all nations where a [[Celtic Languages|Celtic language]] is spoken and share in Celtic organisations (see [[Pan Celticism]]).

Sometimes considered Celtic nations are [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[Asturias]] (both autonomous communities of [[Spain]]), as well as northwest Portugal. Some regions of England and Ireland (in addition to Cornwall) have retained a degree of Celtic influence in their regional dialects (see [[Cumbric]] and [[Hiberno-English]]), although [[Southwestern Brythonic|England's Celtic languages]] died out as recently as the 18th century in Devon and Cornwall.

=== Other languages ===

Outside of these seven main linguistic groups one can find:

* The [[Greek language]], an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]] spoken in [[Greece]], [[Cyprus]], and parts of [[Turkey]], [[Albania]], and [[Italy]], and in [[Greek diaspora]] communities in several other European countries (most notably [[Germany]]).
* The [[Albanian language]], which, like the Greek language, forms its own independent branch of the Indo-European language family with no close living relatives. Major Albanian-speaking communities outside Albania live in Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro, Greece, and Turkey.
* The [[North Caucasian languages|North Caucasian]], a group that includes ethnic groups throughout the [[Caucasus]] region (both North and South). North Caucasian languages are divided into two main branches: [[Northeast Caucasian]] and [[Northwest Caucasian]]. This group includes [[Abkhaz people|Abkhaz]], [[Chechens]], [[Ingush]], [[Bats people|Bats]], and a number of other smaller ethnic groups that reside in the [[Caucasus]].
* The [[South Caucasian languages|South Caucasian]], or Kartvelian languages, a group that includes [[Georgian language]].
* The [[Maltese language]], a heavily [[Romance language|Romanticized]] [[Semitic language]], is spoken in [[Malta]]. Unlike other [[Semitic languages]], Maltese is written in the [[Roman alphabet]].
* The [[Basque language]] is spoken in parts of southern France and northern Spain, i.e. the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]]

{{main|Religion in Europe}}

The most popular religions of Europe are the following:

* '''[[Christianity]]'''
** '''[[Roman Catholicism]]''': Countries or areas with significant Catholic populations are [[Andorra]], [[Austria]], west [[Belarus]], [[Belgium]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Croatia]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[France]], south and west [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Northern Ireland]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Latgale]] region in [[Latvia]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Lithuania]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Malta]], [[Monaco]], south [[Netherlands]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]], [[San Marino]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Spain]], central and south [[Switzerland]], and [[Vatican City]]. There are also large Catholic minorities in [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and most European countries.
** '''[[Eastern Rite Catholic Churches|Eastern-Rite Catholicism]]''': including west [[Ukraine]].
** '''[[Orthodox Christianity]]''': The countries with significant Orthodox populations are [[Albania]], [[Armenia]], [[Belarus]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Cyprus]], [[Finland]] ([[Karelia]]), [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Greece]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Moldova]], [[Montenegro]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[Serbia]] and [[Ukraine]].
** '''[[Protestantism]]''': Countries with significant Protestant populations include [[Denmark]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], north and east [[Germany]], [[Iceland]], [[Latvia]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], east, north and west [[Switzerland]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. There are significant minorities in [[France]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]].
* '''[[Islam]]''': Countries with significant Muslim population are [[Albania]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Montenegro]], several republics of [[Russia]], [[Serbia]] (especially in [[Kosovo]]), [[Turkey]], [[Crimea]] in [[Ukraine]]. Also, [[as of 2005]], about 5% of the EU identify themselves as Muslims, with small but well-established immigrant communities in [[Germany]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Benelux]], [[Sweden]] and [[France]].

Other religions are practised by smaller groups in Europe, including:

* '''[[Judaism]]''', mainly in [[Germany]], [[France]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Russia]] and [[Turkey]].
* '''[[Hinduism]]''', mainly among [[India]]n immigrants in the [[United Kingdom]].
* '''[[Buddhism]]''', thinly spread throughout western Europe, and in [[Kalmykia]], [[Russia]]
* Indigenous European '''[[Polytheistic reconstructionism|pagan]]''' traditions and beliefs, many countries.
* '''[[Rastafari]]''', communities in the [[United Kingdom]], France, Spain, Portugal, Italy and elsewhere.
* '''[[Sikhism]]''' and '''[[Jainism]]''', both mainly among Indian immigrants in the [[United Kingdom]].
* '''[[Voodoo]]''', mainly among [[blacks|black]] [[Caribbean]] and [[West African]] immigrants in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]].
* '''[[African religions|Traditional African Religions]]''' (including [[Muti]]), mainly in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]].

Millions of Europeans profess no religion or are atheist or agnostic. The largest non-confessional populations (as a percentage) are found in [[Sweden]], the [[Czech Republic]], and [[France]], although most former [[communist]] countries have significant non-confessional populations. Attendance at church is a minority activity in most Western European countries - as an example, the Church of England attracts around 1 million worshippers on a Sunday [http://www.cofe.anglican.org/news/pr0306.html], which corresponds to about 2% of the population of [[England]].

=== Official religions ===

A number of countries in Europe have [[official religion]]s, including [[Liechtenstein]], [[Malta]], [[Monaco]], [[Vatican City]] (Catholic), [[Greece]] (Eastern Orthodox); [[Denmark]], [[Iceland]], and [[Norway]] (Lutheran). In [[Switzerland]], some [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] are officially Catholic, others Reformed Protestant. Some Swiss villages even have their religion as well as the village name written on the signs at their entrances.

[[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] has no established church, but the [[Georgian Orthodox Church]] enjoys &quot;''de facto''&quot; privileged status. In [[Finland]], both [[Finnish Orthodox Church]] and [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland|Lutheran church]] are official. [[England]], a part of the [[UK]], has [[Anglicanism]] as its official religion. [[Scotland]], another part of the UK, has Presbyterianism as the 'National' church, but is no longer &quot;official&quot;, and in [[Sweden]], the 'National' church is [[Lutheran]], but no longer &quot;official&quot;. [[Azerbaijan]], [[France]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]],  and [[Turkey]] are officially &quot;secular&quot;.

<pre>This is an example //Tiddlypedia// - a collection of Wikipedia articles collected into a [[TiddlyWiki|http://www.tiddlywiki.com]].

The articles have all been downloaded directly from Wikipedia without editing (although in one or two cases some problematic text has been removed). The tiddlers then have their //wikiformat// field set to //mediawiki//, to identify them to the TiddlyWiki formatter.

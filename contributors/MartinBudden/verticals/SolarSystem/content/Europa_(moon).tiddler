'''Europa''' ({{IPA2|juˈroʊpə}} {{Audio|en-Europa.ogg|listen}}; [[Greek language|Greek]] ''Ευρώπη'') is the sixth nearest and fourth largest [[natural satellite]] of the [[planet]] [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]]. Europa is primarily composed of [[silicate]] rock, has an outer layer of [[water]], and likely has an [[iron]] core. At just over 3000 kilometers in [[diameter]], it is slightly smaller than the Earth's moon, making Europa the [[List of natural satellites by diameter|sixth largest moon]] in the [[Solar System]]. The satellite has a very tenuous [[oxygen]] atmosphere and one of the smoothest surfaces in the solar system. Europa was discovered in [[1610]] by [[Galileo Galilei]] (and independently by [[Simon Marius]] shortly thereafter) and is the smallest of the four [[Galilean moon|Galilean moons]] named in Galileo's honor. 

Due to the hypothesized ocean beneath its icy surface, and an energy source provided by [[tidal heating]], but also because of an oxygen atmosphere, Europa has been cited as a possible host of [[extraterrestrial life]].&lt;ref&gt;Tritt, C. S.; [http://people.msoe.edu/~tritt/sf/europa.life.html ''Possibility of Life on Europa'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PlanetarySocEuropa&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Projects: Europa Mission Campaign: Campaign Update: 2007 Budget Proposal |author=Friedman, L. |url=http://www.planetary.org/programs/projects/explore_europa/update_12142005.html |publisher=The Planetary Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Europa2007Budget&quot;&gt;David, L.; [http://www.space.com/news/060207_europa_budget.html ''Europa Mission: Lost In NASA Budget''], Space.com ([[7 February]] [[2006]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EuropaOxygenJPL&quot;&gt;http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/europa/hst.html&lt;/ref&gt; The intriguing character of Europa has led to a number of ambitious exploration proposals; to date, only flyby missions have visited the moon.

==Etymology==
Europa is named after [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]], daughter of [[Agenor]], king of the [[Phoenicia]]n city of [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]] (now in [[Lebanon]]), and sister of [[Cadmus]], founder of [[Thebes, Greece]].

Although the name &quot;Europa&quot; was suggested by [[Simon Marius]] soon after the moon's discovery&lt;ref&gt;Marius, S.; ([[1614]]) [http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/marius.html ''Mundus Iovialis anno M.DC.IX Detectus Ope Perspicilli Belgici''], where he [http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/observations/jupiter_satellites.html attributes the suggestion] to [[Johannes Kepler]]&lt;/ref&gt;, the name fell out of favor for a considerable time (as did those of the other [[Galilean moons]]), and was not revived into common use until the mid-[[20th century]].&lt;ref name=&quot;marazzini&quot;&gt;Marazzini, C.; (2005); ''The names of the satellites of Jupiter: from Galileo to Simon Marius'', Lettere Italiana, Vol. 57, No. 3, pp. 391-407&lt;/ref&gt; In much of the earlier [[astronomy|astronomical]] literature, it is simply referred to by its [[Roman numerals|Roman numeral]] designation as '''{{nowrap|Jupiter II}}''' (a system introduced by Galileo) or as the &quot;second satellite of Jupiter&quot;. The discovery of [[Amalthea (moon)|Amalthea]] in [[1892]], closer than any of the [[Galilean moons|other known moons of Jupiter]], pushed Europa to third position. The [[Voyager probes|''Voyager'' probes]] discovered three more [[Inner satellites of Jupiter|inner satellites]] in [[1979]], so Europa is now considered Jupiter's sixth satellite, though it is still sometimes referred to as {{nowrap|Jupiter II}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;marazzini&quot;/&gt;

==Orbit==
Europa orbits Jupiter in just three and a half days, following a very nearly circular orbit (with an eccentricity of only 0.009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/europa/#overview ''Overview of Europa Facts''], [[NASA]] webpage (accessed [[15 April]] [[2006]])&lt;/ref&gt;) with a radius of about 670,900 [[kilometre|km]] (416,900 [[mile|mi]]).

Like all the Galilean satellites, Europa is [[tidal locking|tidally locked]] to Jupiter, with one hemisphere of the satellite constantly facing the planet. Because of its orbit's slight eccentricity, maintained by the gravitational disturbances from the other Galilean satellites of the planet, the sub-jovian point oscillates about a mean position. Europa strives to assume a slightly elongated shape pointing towards Jupiter in response to the [[tidal force]] of the giant planet; because different parts of Europa end up being on different points of this departure from sphericity at varying times, the crust flexes up and down. This motion dissipates energy from Jupiter's rotation into Europa ([[tidal heating]]), giving the moon a source of heat and energy, allowing the subsurface ocean to stay liquefied and driving subsurface geological processes.&lt;!--- deadlink: [http://geology.asu.edu/~glg_intro/planetary/p8.htm ''Tidal Heating''] ---&gt;

==Physical characteristics==
[[Image:PIA01130 Interior of Europa.jpg|left|thumb|220px|Interior of Europa]]
===Internal structure===
Europa is somewhat similar in bulk composition to the [[terrestrial planet]]s, being primarily composed of [[silicate]] [[rock (geology)|rock]]. It has an outer layer of [[water]] thought to be around 100 km thick (some, as frozen ice upper crust; some, as liquid ocean underneath the ice), and recent [[magnetic field]] data from the [[Galileo spacecraft|''Galileo'']] orbiter probe, which orbited Jupiter and studied Europa between 1995 and 2003, shows that Europa generates an induced magnetic field by interacting with Jupiter's field, which suggests the presence of a subsurface conductive layer which is likely a salty liquid-water ocean. Europa probably also contains a [[metal]]lic [[iron]] core.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kivelson&quot;&gt;Kivelson, M. G.; ''et al.''; [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/289/5483/1340 ''Galileo Magnetometer Measurements: A Stronger Case for a Subsurface Ocean at Europa''], [[Science (journal)|Science]], Vol. 289, No. 5483 ([[25 August]] [[2000]]), pp. 1340-1343 (accessed [[15 April]] [[2006]])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surface features===
The Europan surface is relatively smooth; few features more than a few hundred metres high have been observed, but topographic relief in places approaches a kilometre (0.62 mi){{fact|date=February 2007}}. Europa is one of the smoothest objects in the solar system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/moons/europa.html ''Europa: Another Water World?''], NASA JPL Galileo Project: Moons and Rings of Jupiter&lt;/ref&gt; The prominent markings crisscrossing the moon seem to be mainly [[albedo feature]]s, which emphasize low topography. There are very few [[Impact crater|crater]]s on Europa because its surface is active and young.&lt;ref&gt;Arnett, B.; [http://www.astro.auth.gr/ANTIKATOPTRISMOI/nineplanets/nineplanets/europa.html ''Europa''] ([[November 7]], [[1996]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EuropaAlbedo&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.solarviews.com/eng/europa.htm |author=Hamilton, C. J. |title=Jupiter's Moon Europa }}&lt;/ref&gt; Europa's [[albedo]] (light reflectivity) of 0.64 is one of the highest of all moons because of its icy surface.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/europa/ ''Europa, a Continuing Story of Discovery''], NASA JPL Project Galileo&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EuropaAlbedo&quot;/&gt; This would seem to indicate a young and active surface; based on estimates of the frequency of [[comet]]ary bombardment that Europa probably endures, the surface is about 20 to 180 million years old&lt;ref name=&quot;Schenk&quot;&gt;Schenk, P. M.; Chapman, C. R.; Zahnle, K.; Moore, J. M.; ''Chapter 18: Ages and Interiors: the Cratering Record of the Galilean Satellites'', in ''Jupiter: The Planet, Satellites and Magnetosphere'', Cambridge University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; (the geological features of the surface clearly show a variety of ages{{fact|date=July 2007}}). Cynthia Phillips, a member of SETI and an expert on Europa states there is currently no consensus among the often contradictory explanations for the surface features of Europa.[http://www.astrobio.net/news/article603.html]

====Lineae====
{{Main|List of lineae on Europa}}
[[Image:europa_g1_true.jpg|right|thumb|275px|Approximately natural color image of Europa by the ''Galileo'' spacecraft]]
Europa's most striking surface feature is a series of dark streaks criss-crossing the entire globe. Close examination shows that the edges of Europa's crust on either side of the cracks have moved relative to each other. The larger bands are roughly 20 km (12 mi) across commonly with dark diffuse outer edges, regular striations, and a central band of lighter material.

Among the controversial hypotheses put forward to explain these features, one states that they may have been produced by a series of [[cryovolcano|volcanic water eruptions]] or geysers as the Europan crust spread open to expose warmer layers beneath. The effect would have been similar to that seen in the Earth's [[oceanic ridge]]s. These various fractures are thought to have been caused in large part by the tidal stresses exerted by Jupiter; since Europa is tidally locked to Jupiter, and therefore always maintains the same approximate orientation towards the planet, the stress patterns should form a distinctive and predictable pattern. However, only the youngest of Europa's fractures conform to the predicted pattern; other fractures appear to have occurred at increasingly different orientations the older they are. This could be explained if Europa's surface rotates slightly faster than its interior, an effect which is possible due to the subsurface ocean mechanically decoupling the moon's surface from its rocky mantle and to the effects of Jupiter's gravity tugging on the moon's outer ice crust. Comparisons of ''[[Voyager program|Voyager]]'' and ''Galileo'' spacecraft photos serve to put an upper limit on this hypothetical slippage of no faster than once every 10,000 years for the surface relative to its interior.

====Other geological features====
{{Main|List of geological features on Europa}}
[[Image:Europa chaotic terrain.jpg|thumb|275px|right|Craggy mountains and smooth plates jumbled together in the [[Conamara Chaos]] region]]
Another type of feature present on Europa are circular and elliptical ''lenticulae'', [[Latin]] for &quot;[[freckle]]s&quot;. Many are domes, some are pits and some are smooth dark spots. Others have a jumbled or rough texture. The dome tops look like pieces of the older plains around them, suggesting that the domes formed when the plains were pushed up from below.

Among the controversial hypotheses put forward to explain these features, one states that these lenticulae were formed by [[diapir]]s of warm ice rising up through the colder ice of the outer crust, much like [[magma chamber]]s in the Earth's crust. The smooth dark spots could be formed by melt water released when the warm ice breaks through the surface, and the rough, jumbled lenticulae (called regions of &quot;chaos&quot;, for example the [[Conamara Chaos]]) would then be formed from many small fragments of crust embedded in hummocky dark material, perhaps like [[iceberg]]s in a frozen sea.

===Subsurface ocean===
[[Image:EuropaInterior1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Two possible models of Europa]]
It is thought that under the surface there is a layer of liquid water kept warm by [[Tidal force|tidally]] generated heat. The temperature on the surface of Europa averages about 110 [[kelvin|K]] (-163 °C) at the equator and only 50 K (-223 °C) at the poles, and so the surface water ice is permanently frozen. The first hints of a subsurface ocean came from theoretical considerations of the tidal heating (a consequence of Europa's slightly eccentric orbit and [[orbital resonance]] with the other Galilean moons). ''[[Galileo spacecraft|Galileo]]'' imaging team members have analyzed ''[[Voyager program|Voyager]]'' and ''Galileo'' images of Europa to argue that Europa's geological features also demonstrate the existence of a subsurface ocean.&lt;ref name=greenberg&gt;Greenberg, R.; ''Europa: The Ocean Moon: Search for an Alien Biosphere'', Springer Praxis Books, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The most dramatic example is &quot;[[chaos terrain]],&quot; a common feature on Europa's surface that some interpret as a region where the subsurface ocean melted through the icy crust. This interpretation is extremely controversial. Most geologists who have studied Europa favor what is commonly called the &quot;thick ice&quot; model, in which the ocean has rarely, if ever, directly interacted with the surface.&lt;ref name=greeley&gt;Greeley, R.; ''et al.''; ''Chapter 15: Geology of Europa'', in ''Jupiter: The Planet, Satellites and Magnetosphere'', Cambridge University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The different models for the estimation of the ice shell thickness give values between a few hundred meters and tens of kilometers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billings&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title= The great thickness debate: Ice shell thickness models for Europa and comparisons with estimates based on flexure at ridges|author= Billings, S. E. |coauthor=Kattenhorn, S. A. |journal=Icarus |volume= 177 |issue=2 | pages=pp. 397-412|year= 2005 |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2005.03.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The best evidence for the so called &quot;thick ice&quot; model is a study of Europa's large craters. The largest craters are surrounded by concentric rings and appear to be filled with relatively flat, fresh ice; based on this and on the calculated amount of heat generated by Europan tides, it is predicted that the outer crust of solid ice is approximately 10–30 kilometers (5–20 mi) thick, including a ductile &quot;warm ice&quot; layer, which could mean that the liquid ocean underneath may be about 100 km (60–65 mi) deep&lt;ref name=&quot;Schenk&quot;/&gt;. This lead to a volume of Europa's oceans of 3{{e|18}}m³, slightly less than three times the volume of Earth's oceans. 

The so called &quot;thin ice&quot; model is a conclusion of the formation of ridges and the flexure of the ice shell due to loading at the surface. With these models the crust of solid ice could be as thin as 200 meters. The &quot;thin ice&quot; model allows regular contact of the liquid interior with the surface through open ridges.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billings&quot;/&gt;

The ''[[Galileo spacecraft|Galileo]]'' orbiter has also found that Europa has a weak [[magnetic field]] (about one quarter the strength of Ganymede's field and similar to Callisto's) which varies periodically as Europa passes through Jupiter's massive magnetic field. A likely explanation of this is that there is a large, subsurface ocean of liquid salt water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kivelson&quot;/&gt; Spectrographic evidence suggests that the dark reddish streaks and features on Europa's surface may be rich in salts such as [[magnesium sulfate]], deposited by evaporating water that emerged from within. [[Sulfuric acid]] hydrate is another possible explanation for the contaminant observed spectroscopically. In either case, since these materials are colorless or white when pure, some other material must also be present to account for the reddish color. [[Sulfur]] compounds are suspected.

===Atmosphere===
In 1994, observations with the [[Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph]] of the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] revealed that Europa has a very tenuous [[celestial body's atmosphere|atmosphere]] (1 [[pascal (unit)|micropascal]] surface pressure) composed mostly of  [[oxygen|molecular oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;Hall, D. T.; ''et al.''; [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v373/n6516/abs/373677a0.html ''Detection of an oxygen atmosphere on Jupiter's moon Europa''], [[Nature (journal)|Nature]], Vol. 373 ([[23 February]] [[1995]]), pp. 677-679 (accessed [[15 April]] [[2006]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EuropaOxygenJPL&quot;&gt;http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/europa/hst.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the oxygen in [[Earth's atmosphere]], Europa's is not of biological origin. It is most likely generated by charged particles (ions and electrons) hitting Europa's icy surface, splitting water into OH and H (atomic [[hydrogen]]).  Chemical reactions between these products lead eventually to some combination of molecular oxygen, molecular hydrogen, hydrogen peroxide, or back into water.  This process is called [[radiolysis]].  The same radiation also ejects these products from the surface onto ballistic trajectories; thus forming an &quot;atmosphere&quot;.  Molecular oxygen is the densest component of the atmosphere because it has a long lifetime; after returning to the surface from a ballistic arc, it does not stick (freeze) to the surface like a water molecule or hydrogen peroxide molecule, rather it desorbs from the surface and starts another ballistic arc.  Molecular hydrogen also does not freeze onto the surface, but is so light that it easily escapes Europa's gravity.   

Observations of the surface have revealed that some of the molecular oxygen produced by radiolysis is not ejected from the surface.    Since the surface may interact with the subsurface ocean (based on the geological discussion above), this molecular oxygen may make its way to the ocean, where it could aid in biological processes. &lt;ref&gt; Chyba and Hand, &quot;Life without photosynthesis&quot; [http://science-mag.aaas.org/cgi/content/summary/292/5524/2026] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Exploration==
Most of our knowledge of Europa comes from the flybys by the ''[[Voyager program|Voyager]]'' and ''[[Galileo spacecraft|Galileo]]'' missions. Various proposals have been made for future missions. Any mission to Europa would need to be protected from the high radiation levels sustained by Jupiter.&lt;ref name=&quot;PlanetarySocEuropa&quot;/&gt; The aims of these missions have ranged from examining Europa's chemical composition, to searching for [[extraterrestrial life]] in its sub-surface ocean.&lt;ref name=&quot;EuropaLife&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Thin ice opens lead for life on Europa |author=Chandler, D. L. |date=20 October 2002 |url=http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn2929 |publisher=NewScientist.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muir, H.; [http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn2313 ''Europa has raw materials for life''], NewScientist.com ([[22 May]] [[2002]])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible extraterrestrial life===
[[Image:Pompeii worm colony.jpg|thumb|205px|right|Life in such an ocean could possibly be similar to life on Earth's [[deep ocean]]]]

It has been suggested that [[extraterrestrial life|life]] may exist in this under-ice ocean, perhaps subsisting in an environment similar to Earth's deep-ocean [[hydrothermal vent]]s or the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] [[Lake Vostok]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.nasa.gov/newhome/headlines/ast10dec99_2.htm ''Exotic Microbes Discovered near Lake Vostok''], Science@NASA ([[December 10]], [[1999]])&lt;/ref&gt; Life in such an ocean could possibly be similar to [[life on earth]] in the [[deep ocean]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EuropaLife&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, N.; [http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn1647 ''Bacterial explanation for Europa's rosy glow''], NewScientist.com ([[11 December]] [[2001]])&lt;/ref&gt; So far, there is no evidence that life exists on Europa but due to the likely presence of liquid water, there are proposals to send a probe there.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, C.; [http://www.space.com/searchforlife/seti_europa_060928.html ''Time for Europa''], Space.com ([[28 September]] [[2006]])&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Pappalardo, an assistant professor within the University of Colorado's space department, said &quot;We’ve spent quite a bit of time and effort trying to understand if Mars was once a habitable environment. Europa today, probably, is a habitable environment. We need to confirm this… but Europa, potentially, has all the ingredients for life… and not just four billion years ago… but today&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Europa2007Budget&quot;&gt;David, L.; [http://www.space.com/news/060207_europa_budget.html ''Europa Mission: Lost In NASA Budget''], Space.com ([[7 February]] [[2006]])&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent budget cuts have prevented proposed missions to search for life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Budget&quot;&gt;Berger, B.; [http://www.space.com/news/nasa_budget_050207.html ''NASA 2006 Budget Presented: Hubble, Nuclear Initiative Suffer''] [[Space.com]] ([[7 February]] [[2005]])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spacecraft proposals and cancellations===
[[Image:Cryobot.jpg|thumb|right|205px|Artist's concept of the [[cryobot]] and hydrobot]]
The plan for the extremely ambitious [[Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter]] was canceled in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;Budget&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PlanetarySocEuropa&quot;/&gt;
The 2006 NASA budget includes Congressional language imploring NASA to fund a mission that would orbit Europa.  Such a mission would be able to do the following:
#Confirm a subsurface ocean using gravity and altimetry measurements
#Elucidate the origin of surface features by imaging much of the surface at high resolution
#Constrain the chemistry of surface materials using spectroscopy
#Probe for subsurface liquid water using ice-penetrating radar.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbitts, K.; and Mullen, L.; [http://www.astrobio.net/news/article1944.html ''Hitting Europa Hard''], Astrobiology Magazine ([[May 1]], [[2006]])&lt;/ref&gt;
#Carry a small lander to determine the surface chemistry directly, and to measure seismic waves, from which the level of activity and ice thickness could be determined.  

However, at present it is far from certain that NASA will actually fund this mission, as funding for it is not included in NASA's 2007 budget plan.&lt;ref name=&quot;PlanetarySocEuropa&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Europa2007Budget&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Nature|volume= 437|year= 2005| pages=8|doi=10.1038/437008a |title=Designs on Europa unfurl|author=Tony Reichhardt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Planetary scientist Ronald Greeley said about the Europa mission:&lt;ref name=&quot;Europa2007Budget&quot;/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I am disappointed that after so many false starts over the last decade, it looks like a mission to Europa is slipping once again. The planetary community remains essentially unanimous in setting Europa as the highest priority large mission to the outer solar system&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Additionally, NASA Chief Mike Griffin said the following about the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter:&lt;ref name=&quot;Europa2007Budget&quot;/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;It was not a mission, in my judgment, that was well-formulated. [A scientific mission to Europa] is extremely interesting on a scientific basis. It remains a very high priority, and you may look forward, in the next year or so, or maybe even sooner, to a proposal for a Europa mission as part of our science line. But we would not -- we would, again, not -- favor linking that to a nuclear propulsion system.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another possible mission, known as the &quot;Ice Clipper&quot; mission, would use an impactor similar to the [[Deep Impact (space mission)|Deep Impact]] DI mission -- it would make a controlled crash into the surface of Europa, generating a plume of debris which would then be collected by a small spacecraft flying through the plume.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, J.; [http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/oct98/905357947.As.r.html ''Re: Galileo at Europa''], MadSci Network forums, [[September 9]], [[1998]]&lt;/ref&gt; Without the need for an insertion and relaunch of the spacecraft(s) from an orbit around Jupiter or Europa, this would be one of the least expensive missions since the necessary amount of fuel would be decreased.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal|title=Planetary protection for a Europa surface sample return: The ice clipper mission |author=McKay C. P.|journal= Advances in Space Research|volume= 30|issue=6|pages=1601-1605|year= 2002}}  &lt;/ref&gt; 

More ambitious ideas have been put forward for a capable lander to test for evidence of life that might be frozen in the shallow subsurface, or even to directly explore the possible ocean beneath Europa's ice. One proposal calls for a large [[nuclear power]]ed &quot;Melt Probe&quot; ([[cryobot]]) which would melt through the ice until it hit the ocean below.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, W.; [http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn1786 ''Ice-melting robot passes Arctic test''], NewScientist.com ([[14 January]] [[2002]])&lt;/ref&gt; The Planetary Society says that drilling a hole below the surface would be a main goal, and provide protection from radiation.&lt;ref name=&quot;PlanetarySocEuropa&quot;/&gt; Once it reached the water, it would deploy an autonomous underwater vehicle (hydrobot), which would gather information and send it back to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Bridges, A.; [http://www.space.com/searchforlife/europa_ocean_update_000110.html ''Latest Galileo Data Further Suggest Europa Has Liquid Ocean''], Space.com ([[10 January]] [[2000]])&lt;/ref&gt; Both the [[cryobot]] and the hydrobot would have to undergo some form of extreme sterilization to prevent it from detecting earth organisms instead of native life and to prevent [[Forward-contamination|contamination]] of the subsurface ocean.&lt;ref&gt;National Academy of Sciences Space Studies Board, [http://www7.nationalacademies.org/ssb/europamenu.html ''Preventing the Forward Contamination of Europa''], National Academy Press, Washington (DC), [[June 29]], [[2000]]&lt;/ref&gt; This proposed mission has not yet reached a serious planning stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=NEMO: A mission to search for and return to Earth possible life forms on Europa |author=Powell, J. |coauthors=Powell, J.&lt;!--- Yes, two different J.

Even though Congress, the National Academy of Sciences, and the NASA advisory committee have all supported a mission to Europa, funding has still been halted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/NASA_Budget_Shuts_Out_Icy_Moons_Mission.html ''NASA Budget Shuts Out Icy Moons Mission''], SpaceDaily.com ([[February 08]], [[2006]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berardelli, P.; [http://www.space-travel.com/reports/AAS_Pushing_NASA_To_Rethink_Its_FY_2007_Budget.html ''AAS Pushing NASA To Rethink Its FY 2007 Budget''], Space-Travel.com ([[May 5]], [[2006]])&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Planetary Society]] plans on creating the &quot;International Europa Task Force&quot; to convince NASA and other space agencies to fund a Europa mission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetary.org/programs/projects/explore_europa/facts.html ''Projects: Europa Mission Campaign: Campaign Facts: International Europa Task Force''], The Planetary Society&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetary.org/programs/projects/explore_europa ''Projects: Europa Mission Campaign], The Planetary Society&lt;/ref&gt; Other people, such as congressman John Culberson, have also tried to go against NASA's budget cuts.&lt;ref&gt;David, L.; [http://www.space.com/searchforlife/seti_culberson_060316.html ''Lawmaker Campaigns Against NASA Budget Cuts''], Space.com ([[16 March]] [[2006]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bourge, C.; [http://www.govexec.com/dailyfed/0706/073106cdam1.htm ''Lawmakers steer NASA funding toward science mission''], GovExec.com ([[July 31]], [[2006]])&lt;/ref&gt;

A &quot;Solar System Exploration Roadmap&quot; published for NASA by the [[Universities Space Research Association]] in [[2006]] placed exploration of Europa high on its list, and suggested that plans for a &quot;flagship-class&quot; mission to Europa begin by [[2008]] with hopes to launch by [[2015]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Solar System Exploration: This is the 2006 Solar System Exploration Roadmap for NASA's Science Mission Directorate |publisher=Universities Space Research Association |url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/vexag/road_map_final.pdf |date=September 2006 |accessdate=September 29 |accessyear=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

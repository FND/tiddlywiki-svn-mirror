The Kuiper belt should not be confused with the hypothesized [[Oort cloud]], which is a thousand times more distant. The objects within the Kuiper belt, together with the members of the [[scattered disc]] and any potential [[Hills cloud]] or [[Oort cloud]] objects, are collectively referred to as [[trans-Neptunian object]]s (TNOs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM OF ASTEROIDS AS OF MAY 20, 2004|author= Gérard FAURE|url=http://www.astrosurf.com/aude/map/us/AstFamilies2004-05-20.htm|year=2004|accessdate=2007-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Since the discovery of Pluto, many have speculated that it might not be alone. The region now called the Kuiper belt had been hypothesized in various forms for decades. It was only in 1992 that the first direct evidence for its existence was found. The number and variety of prior speculations on the nature of the Kuiper belt have led to continued uncertainty as to who deserves credit for first proposing it.
  
The first [[astronomer]] to suggest the existence of a trans-Neptunian population was [[Frederick C. Leonard]] in 1930, soon after Pluto's discovery, who pondered whether it was &quot;not likely that in Pluto there has come to light the ''first'' of a ''series'' of ultra-Neptunian bodies, the remaining members of which still await discovery but which are destined eventually to be detected&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is improper about the term &quot;Kuiper belt&quot;? (or, Why name a thing after a man who didn't believe its existence?)|url=http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/icq/kb.html|Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics|accessdate=2007-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
===Subsequent hypotheses===
[[Image:GerardKuiper.jpg|thumb|150 px|Astronomer [[Gerard Kuiper]], after whom the Kuiper belt is named]]
In 1943, in the ''Journal of the British Astronomical Association'', [[Kenneth Edgeworth]] hypothesised that, in the region beyond [[Neptune]], the material within the primordial [[solar nebula]] was too widely spaced to condense into planets, and so rather condensed into a myriad of smaller bodies. From this he concluded that “the outer region of the solar system, beyond the orbits of the planets, is occupied by a very large number of comparatively small bodies&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Beyond Pluto: Exploring the outer limits of the solar system |author=John Davies|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2001|pages=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that, from time to time, one of their number &quot;wanders from its own sphere and appears as an occasional visitor to the inner solar system,”&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  becoming what we call a [[comet]].   

In 1951, in an article for the journal ''Astrophysics'', [[Gerard Kuiper]] speculated on a similar disc having formed early in the Solar System's evolution, however, he did not believe that such a belt still existed today. Kuiper was operating on the assumption common in his time, that [[Pluto]] was the size of the Earth, and had therefore scattered these bodies out toward the Oort cloud or out of the Solar System. By Kuiper's formulation, there wouldn't be a Kuiper belt where we now see it.&lt;ref name=Jewitt&gt;{{cite web|title=WHY &quot;KUIPER&quot; BELT?|author=David Jewitt|work=University of Hawaii|url=http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/faculty/jewitt/kb/gerard.html|accessdate=2007-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The hypothesis took many other forms in the following decades: in 1962, physicist [[Alastair GW Cameron|Al G.W. Cameron]] postulated the existence of “a tremendous mass of small material on the outskirts of the solar system,”&lt;ref name=Davies2&gt;Davies, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; while in 1964, [[Fred Whipple]], who popularised the famous &quot;[[dirty snowball]]&quot; hypothesis for cometary structure, thought that a &quot;comet belt&quot; might be massive enough to cause the purported discrepancies in the orbit of [[Uranus]] that had sparked the search for [[Planet X]], or at the very least, to affect the orbits of known comets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EVIDENCE FOR A COMET BELT BEYOND NEPTUNE|author=FOR A COMET BELT BEYOND NEPTUNE
BY FRED L. WHIPPLE|work=SMITHSONIAN ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY AND HARVARD COLLEGE OBSERVATORY|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/51/5/711.pdf|year=1964|accessdate=2007-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Observation, however, ruled out this hypothesis.&lt;ref name=Davies2 /&gt; 

In 1977, [[Charles Kowal]] discovered [[2060 Chiron]], an icy planetoid with an orbit between Saturn and Uranus. He used a [[blink comparator]]; the same device that had allowed [[Clyde Tombaugh]] to discover [[Pluto]] nearly 50 years before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The discovery and orbit of /2060/ Chiron|author= CT Kowal, W Liller, BG Marsden|work=Hale Observatories, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1979IAUS...81..245K|year=1977|accessdate=2007-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1992, another object [[5145 Pholus]], was discovered in a similar orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1992 AD|author=JV Scotti, DL Rabinowitz, CS Shoemaker, EM Shoemaker, DH Levy,  TM King, EF Helin, J Alu, K Lawrence, RH McNaught, L Frederick, D Tholen, BEA Mueller|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992IAUC.5434....1S|year=1992|accessdate=2007-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, an entire population, the [[centaur (planetoid)|centaurs]], is known to exist in that region. The centaurs' orbits are unstable over periods longer than roughly 100 million years, a relatively short span when compared to the age of the Solar System. From the time of Chiron's discovery, astronomers  speculated that it therefore must be frequently replenished by some outer reservoir.&lt;ref&gt;Davies p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; 

Further evidence for the belt's existence later emerged from the study of comets. That comets have finite lifespans has been known for some time. As they approach the Sun, its heat causes their [[volatility (physics)|volatile]] surfaces to sublimate into space, eating them gradually away. In order to still be visible over the age of the Solar System, they must be frequently replenished.&lt;ref name=matter&gt;{{cite web|title=FROM KUIPER BELT OBJECT TO COMETARY NUCLEUS: THE MISSING ULTRARED MATTER|author=DAVID C. JEWITT |url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/AJ/journal/issues/v123n2/201410/201410.html|year=2001|accessdate=2007-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such area of replenishment is the [[Oort cloud]]; the spherical swarm of comets extending beyond 50,000 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] from the Sun first hypothesised by astronomer [[Jan Oort]] in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Oort|Oort, J. H.]], ''The structure of the cloud of comets surrounding the Solar System and a hypothesis concerning its origin'', Bull. Astron. Inst. Neth., ''11'', p. 91-110 (1950) [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1950BAN....11...91O&amp;amp;data_type=PDF_HIGH&amp;amp;type=PRINTER&amp;amp;filetype=.pdf  Text at Harvard server (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed to be the point of origin for [[long period comet]]s, those, like [[Hale-Bopp]], with orbits lasting thousands of years. 

There is however another comet population, known as [[short-period comet|short period]] or [[periodic comet]]s; those with orbits lasting less than 200 years. By the 1970s, the rate at which short-period comets were being discovered was becoming increasingly inconsistent with them having emerged solely from the [[Oort cloud]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; For an Oort cloud object to become a short-period comet, it would first have to be captured by the giant planets. In 1980, in the monthly notice of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]], [[Julio Fernandez]] stated that for every short period comet to be sent into the inner solar system from the Oort cloud, 600 would have to be ejected into interstellar space. He speculated that a comet belt from between 35 and 50 [[Astronomical Unit|AU]] would be required to account for the observed number of comets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=On the existence of a comet belt beyond Neptune|author=JA Fernandez|work=Observatorio Astronomico Nacional, Madrid|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1980MNRAS.192..481F|year=1980|accessdate=2007-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following up on Fernandez's work, in 1988 the Canadian team of Martin Duncan, Tom Quinn and [[Scott Tremaine]] ran a number of computer simulations to determine if all observed comets could have arrived from the Oort cloud. They found that the Oort cloud could not account for short-period comets, particularly as short-period comets are clustered near the plane of the Solar System, whereas Oort cloud comets tend to arrive from any point in the sky. With a belt as Fernandez described it added to the formulations, the simulations matched observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The origin of short-period comets|author=M. Duncan, T. Quinn, and S. Tremaine|work=The Astrophysical Journal|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/resolve?id=doi:10.1086/185162&amp;erFrom=2675046268734816715Guest|year=1988|accessdate-2007-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reportedly because the words &quot;Kuiper&quot; and &quot;comet belt&quot; appeared in the opening sentence of Fernandez's paper, Tremaine named this region the &quot;Kuiper belt.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Davies p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discovery===
[[Image:Maunatele.jpg|thumb|left|200 px|The array of telescopes atop [[Mauna Kea]], with which the Kuiper belt was discovered]]
In 1987, astronomer [[David Jewitt]], then at [[MIT]], became increasingly puzzled by &quot;the apparent emptiness of the outer Solar System.&quot;&lt;ref name=qbee&gt;{{cite web|title=Discovery of the candidate Kuiper belt object 1992 QB1|author=David Jewitt, Jane Luu|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v362/n6422/abs/362730a0.html|work=Nature|year=1992|accessdate=2007-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He encouraged then-graduate student [[Jane Luu]] to aid him in his endeavour to locate another object beyond [[Pluto]]'s orbit, because, as he told her, &quot;If we don't, nobody will.&quot;&lt;ref name=Davies3&gt;Davies p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Using telescopes at the [[Kitt Peak National Observatory]] in [[Arizona]] and the [[Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory]] in [[Chile]], Jewitt and Luu conducted their search in much the same way as Clyde Tombaugh and Charles Kowal had, with a blink comparator.&lt;ref name=Davies3 /&gt; Initially, examination of each pair of plates took about eight hours,&lt;ref&gt;Davies p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; but the process was speeded up with the arrival of electronic [[Charge-coupled device]]s or CCDs, which, though their field of view was narrower, were not only more efficient at collecting light (they retained 90 percent of the light that hit them, rather than the ten percent achieved by photographs) but allowed the blinking process to be done virtually, on a computer screen. Today, CCDs form the basis for all astronomical detectors.&lt;ref&gt;Davies pp. 52, 54, 56&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, Jewitt moved to the Institute of Astronomy at the [[University of Hawaii]]. He was later joined by Jane Luu to work at the University of Hawaii’s 2.24 m telescope at Mauna Kea.&lt;ref&gt;Davies pp. 57, 62&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the field of view for CCDs had increased to 1024 by 1024 pixels, which allowed searches to be conducted far more rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;Davies p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, after five years of searching, on [[August 30]], [[1992]], Jewitt and Luu announced the &quot;Discovery of the candidate Kuiper belt object&quot; {{mpl|(15760) 1992 QB|1}};&lt;ref name=qbee /&gt; Six months later, they discovered a second object in the region, 1993 FW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1993 FW|author=BS Marsden|work=Minor Planet Center|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993IAUC.5730....1L|year=1993|accessdate=2007-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Name===
Astronomers sometimes use alternative name '''Edgeworth-Kuiper belt''' to credit Edgeworth, and KBOs are occasionally referred to as EKOs. However, [[Brian Marsden]] claims neither deserve true credit; &quot;Neither Edgeworth or Kuiper wrote about anything remotely like what we are now seeing, but [[Fred Whipple]] did.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Davies p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; The term '''[[trans-Neptunian object]]''' (TNO) is recommended for objects in the belt by several scientific groups because the term is less controversial than all others &amp;mdash; it is not a [[synonym]] though, as TNOs include all objects orbiting the Sun at the outer edge of the solar system, not just those in the Kuiper belt.

Since the year 2000, a number of KBOs with diameters of between 500 and 1200 km (about half that of Pluto) have been discovered. [[50000 Quaoar]], a classical KBO discovered in 2002, is over 1200 km across. {{mpl|(136472) 2005 FY|9}} (nicknamed &quot;Easterbunny&quot;) and {{mpl|(136108) 2003 EL|61}} (nicknamed &quot;Santa&quot;), both announced on [[29 July]] [[2005]], are larger still. Other objects, such as [[28978 Ixion]] (discovered in 2001) and [[20000 Varuna]] (discovered in 2000) measure roughly 500 km across.&lt;ref name=beyond /&gt; 

===Pluto===
The discovery of these large KBOs in similar orbits to Pluto led many to conclude that, bar its relative size, [[Pluto]] was not particularly different from other members of the Kuiper belt. Not only did these objects approach Pluto in size, but many also possessed satellites, and were of similar composition (methane and carbon monoxide have been found both on Pluto and on the largest KBOs&lt;ref name=beyond /&gt;). [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] was considered a planet before the discovery of its fellow [[asteroid]]s, and, based on this precedent, many astronomers concluded that Pluto should also be reclassified.

The issue was brought to a head by the discovery of [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], an object in the [[scattered disc]] far beyond the Kuiper belt, that is now known to be 27 percent more massive than Pluto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dysnomia, the moon of Eris|author=Mike Brown|work=CalTech|url=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/planetlila/moon/index.html |year=2007|accessdate=2007-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU), was forced to [[Definition of planet|define a planet]] for the first time, and in so doing included in their definition that a planet must have &quot;[[Clearing the neighborhood|cleared the neighbourhood]] around its orbit.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iau.org/Resolutions_5-6.398.0.html|title=IAU 2006 General Assembly: Resolutions 5 and 6|publisher=IAU|date=24 August 2006|publisher=IAU}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Pluto shared its orbit with so many KBOs, it was deemed not to have cleared its orbit, and was thus reclassified from a planet to a member of the Kuiper belt. 

Though Pluto is the largest KBO, a number of objects outside the Kuiper belt which may have begun their lives as KBOs are larger. Eris is the most obvious example, but Neptune's moon [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], which, as explained above, is probably a captured KBO, is also larger than Pluto.

==Origins==
[[Image:orbits1.jpg|thumb|400px|Simulation showing Outer Planets and Kuiper Belt: a)Before Jupiter/Saturn 2:1 resonance b)Scattering of Kuiper Belt objects into the solar system after the orbital shift of Neptune c)After ejection of Kuiper Belt bodies by Jupiter]]
The precise origins of the Kuiper belt and its complex structure are still unclear, and astronomers are awaiting the completion of the [[Pan-STARRS]] survey telescope, which should reveal many currently unknown KBOs, to determine more about this.&lt;ref name=beyond /&gt; 

The Kuiper belt is believed to consist of [[planetesimals]]; fragments from the original [[protoplanetary disc]] around the [[Sun]] that failed to fully coalesce into planets and instead formed into smaller bodies, the largest less than 3000 km in diameter. 

Modern [[computer]] [[simulation]]s show the Kuiper belt to have been strongly influenced by [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]] and [[Neptune]], and  also suggest that neither [[Uranus]] nor [[Neptune]] could have formed ''in situ'' beyond Saturn, as too little primordial matter existed at that range to produce objects of such high mass. Instead, these planets are believed to have formed closer to Jupiter, but to have been flung outwards during the course of the Solar System's early evolution. Work in 1984 by Fernandez and Ip suggests that exchange of [[angular momentum]] with a the scattered objects can cause the planets to drift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neptune’s Migration into a Stirred–Up Kuiper Belt: A Detailed Comparison of Simulations to Observations|author=Joseph M.

The gravitational pull from such a resonance ultimately disrupted the orbits of Uranus and Neptune, causing them to switch places and for Neptune to travel outward into the proto-Kuiper belt, sending it into temporary chaos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Orbital shuffle for early solar system|author=Kathryn Hansen|work=Geotimes|url=http://www.agiweb.org/geotimes/june05/WebExtra060705.htmlyear=2005|accessdate=2007-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;As Neptune travelled outward, it excited and scattered many TNOs into higher and more eccentric orbits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE FORMATION OF URANUS AND NEPTUNE AMONG JUPITER AND SATURN|author=E.

However, the present models still fail to account for many of the characteristics of the distribution and, quoting one of the scientific articles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nonlinear Resonances in the Solar System|url=http://arxiv.org/abs/chao-dyn/9406004|accessdate=2007-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; the problems &quot;continue to challenge analytical techniques and the fastest numerical modeling hardware and software&quot;.

==Structure==
At its fullest extent, including its outlying regions, the Kuiper belt stretches from roughly 30 to 55 AU. However, the main body of the belt  is generally accepted to extend from the 2:3 resonance ([[#Resonances|see below]]) at 39.5 AU to the 1:2 resonance at roughly 48 AU. The Kuiper belt is quite thick, with the main concentration extending as much as ten degrees outside the [[ecliptic plane]] and a more diffuse distribution of objects extending several times farther. Overall it more resembles a [[torus]] or doughnut than a belt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Discovering the Edge of the Solar System|work=American Scientists.org|url=http://www.americanscientist.org/template/AssetDetail/assetid/25723/page/2;jsessionid=aaa5LVF0|year=2003|accessdate=2007-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its mean position is inclined to the ecliptic by 1.86 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE PLANE OF THE KUIPER BELT|author=Michael E.

[[Image:TheKuiperBelt classes.PNG|right|thumb|250px|Orbit classification (schematic of [[semi-major axis|semi-major axes]]).]]
The presence of [[Neptune]] has a profound effect on the Kuiper belt's structure due to [[orbital resonance]]s. Over a timescale comparable to the age of the Solar System, Neptune's gravity destabilises the orbits of any objects which happen to lie in certain regions, and either sends them into the inner Solar System or out into the [[Scattered disc]] or interstellar space. This causes the Kuiper belt to possess pronounced gaps in its current layout, similar to the [[Kirkwood gap]]s in the [[Asteroid belt]]. In the region between 40 and 42 AU, for instance, no objects can retain a stable orbit over such times, and any observed in that region must have migrated there relatively recently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Large Scattered Planetesimals and the Excitation of the Small Body Belts|author=Jean-Marc Petit, Alessandro Morbidelli, Giovanni B.

===Classical belt===
{{main|Classical Kuiper belt object}}
Between ~42 ~48 AU, however, the gravitational influence of Neptune is negligible, and objects can exist with their orbits pretty much unmolested. This region is known as the [[Classical Kuiper belt object|classical Kuiper belt]], and its members comprise roughly two thirds of KBOs observed to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Kuiper Belt|author=Jonathan Lunine|url=http://www.gsmt.noao.edu/gsmt_swg/SWG_Apr03/The_Kuiper_Belt.pdf|year=2003|accessdate=2007-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CLASSICAL KUIPER BELT OBJECTS (CKBOs)|author=Dave Jewitt|url=http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~jewitt/kb/kb-classical.html|year=2004|accewssdate=2007-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the first modern KBO discovered, [[1992 QB1]], is considered the prototype of this group, classical KBOs are often referred to as [[cubewanos]] (&quot;Q-B-1-os&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cubewano|author=P Murdin|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000eaa..bookE5403|year=2000|accessdate=2007-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE DEEP ECLIPTIC SURVEY: A SEARCH FOR KUIPER BELT OBJECTS AND CENTAURS.

The classical Kuiper belt appears to be a composite of two separate populations. The first, known as &quot;dynamically cold&quot; population, has orbits much like the planets; nearly circular, with an [[orbital eccentricity]] of less than 0.1, and with relatively low inclinations up to about 10° (they lie close to the plane of the Solar System rather than at an angle). The second, the &quot;dynamically hot&quot; population, has orbits much more inclined to the ecliptic, by up to 30°. The two populations have been named this way not because of any major difference in temperature, but from analogy to particles in a gas, which increase their relative velocity as they become heated up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The formation of the Kuiper belt by the outward transport of bodies during Neptune’s migration|author=Harold F. Levison, Alessandro Morbidelli|url=http://www.obs-nice.fr/morby/stuff/NATURE.pdf|year=2003|accessdate=2007-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two populations not only possess different orbits, but different compositions; the cold population is markedly redder than the hot, suggesting it formed in a different region. The hot population is believed to have formed near Jupiter, and to have been ejected out by movements among the gas giants. The cold population, on the other hand, is believed to have formed beyond the primordial Neptune, although it was also later swept outwards by Neptune during its migration.&lt;ref name=beyond /&gt;

===Resonances===
{{main|Resonant trans-Neptunian object}}
[[Image:TheKuiperBelt 75AU All.svg|right|thumb|400px|Distribution of [[cubewano]]s, [[plutino]]s and near [[scattered disk|scattered objects]].]]
When an object's orbital period is an exact ratio of Neptune's (a situation called a [[Orbital resonance|mean motion resonance]]), then it can become locked in a synchronised motion with Neptune and avoid being perturbed away if their relative alignments are appropriate. If, for instance, an object is in just the right kind of orbit so that it orbits the Sun two times for every three Neptune orbits, then whenever it returns to its original position, Neptune will always be half an orbit away from it, since it will have completed 1½ orbits in the same time. This is known as the 2:3 (or 3:2) resonance, and it corresponds to a characteristic [[semi-major axis]] of ~39.4AU. This 2:3 resonance is populated by about 200 objects,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List Of Transneptunian Objects|work=Minor Planet Center|url=http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/iau/lists/TNOs.html|accessdate=2007-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  including [[Pluto]] together with its moons. In recognition of this, the other members of this family are known as [[Plutinos]].  Many Plutinos, including Pluto, often have orbits which cross that of Neptune, though their resonance means they can never collide. Many others, such as [[90482 Orcus]] and [[28978 Ixion]], are over half of Pluto's size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ixion|work=eightplanets.net|url=http://ixion.eightplanets.net/|accesdate=2007-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=albedo&gt;{{cite web|title=Physical Properties of Kuiper Belt and Centaur Objects: Constraints from Spitzer Space Telescope|author=John Stansberry, Will Grundy, Mike Brown, Dale Cruikshank, John Spencer, David Trilling, Jean-Luc Margot|url=http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0702538v1|year=2007|accessdate=2007-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;The 1:2 resonance (whose objects complete half an orbit for each of Neptune's) corresponds to semi-major axes of  ~47.7AU, and is sparsely populated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trans-Neptunian Objects|author=Wm. Robert Johnston|url=http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/astro/tnos.html|year=2007|accessdate=2007-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its residents are sometimes referred to as [[twotino]]s. Minor resonances also exist at 3:4, 3:5, 4:7 and 2:5.&lt;ref&gt;Davies p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, there is a relative absence of objects with semi-major axes below 39 AU which cannot apparently be explained by the present resonances. The currently accepted hypothesis for the cause of this is that as Neptune migrated outward, unstable orbital resonances moved gradually through this region, and thus any objects within it were swept up, or gravitationally ejected from it.&lt;ref&gt;Davies p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

===The &quot;Kuiper cliff&quot;===
[[Image:Semimajorhistogramofkbos.jpg|thumb|400 px|Graph showing the numbers of KBOs for a given distance from the Sun]] 
The 1:2 resonance appears to be an edge beyond which few objects are known. It is not clear whether it is actually the outer edge of the Classical belt or just the beginning of a broad gap. Objects have been detected at the 2:5 resonance  at roughly 55 AU, well outside the classical belt; however, predictions of a large number of bodies in classical orbits between these resonances have not been verified through observation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RESONANCE OCCUPATION IN THE KUIPER BELT: CASE EXAMPLES OF THE 5 : 2 AND TROJAN RESONANCES|author=E.

Earlier models of the Kuiper belt had suggested that the number of large objects would increase by a factor of two beyond 50 AU;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown 1999&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=E. I.

[[Alan Stern]] of the [[Southwest Research Institute]] has claimed that the gravitiational attraction of an unseen large planetary object, perhaps the size of Earth or Mars, might be responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=13 Things that do not make sense|author=Michael Brooks|work=NewScientistSpace.com|url=http://space.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=mg18524911.600|year=2007|accessdate=2007-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bernstein and Trilling et al. have found evidence that the observed rapid decline in objects of 100&amp;nbsp;km or more in radius beyond 50 AU is a real decline in the number of objects, and not just an observational effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = G.M.

===Scattered objects===
{{main|Scattered disc|Triton (moon)|Centaur (planetoid)}}
[[Image:TheKuiperBelt Projections 100AU Classical SDO.svg|left|thumb|240px|The orbits of objects in the scattered disc; the classical KBOs are blue, while the 2:5 resonant objects are green.]]
The scattered disc is a sparsely populated region beyond the Kuiper belt, extending as far as 100 AU and farther. [[Scattered disc object]]s (SDOs) travel in highly elliptical orbits, usually also highly inclined to the ecliptic. Most models of solar system formation show icy planetoids first forming in the Kuiper belt, while later gravitational interactions, particularly with Neptune, displaced some of them outwards into the scattered disc. 

According to the [[Minor Planet Center]], which officially catalogues all trans-Neptunian objects, a KBO, strictly speaking, is any object that orbits exclusively within the defined Kuiper belt region regardless of origin or composition. Objects found outside the belt are classed as scattered objects.&lt;ref name=scattered&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/lists/Centaurs.html|title=List Of Centaurs and Scattered-Disk Objects|work=IAU: Minor Planet Center|accessdate=2007-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in some scientific circles the term &quot;Kuiper belt object&quot; has become synonymous with any icy planetoid native to the outer solar system believed to have been part of that initial class, even if its orbit during the bulk of solar system history has been beyond the Kuiper belt (e.g. in the scattered disk region). They often describe scattered disc objects as &quot;scattered Kuiper belt objects.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year= 2005| author= David Jewitt| title=The 1000 km Scale KBOs| work=University of Hawaii| url=http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/faculty/jewitt/kb/big_kbo.html| accessdate=2006-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other trans-Neptunian researchers have been more cautious in applying the KBO label to objects clearly outside the belt in the current epoch. [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], the recently discovered object now known to be larger than Pluto, is often referred to as a KBO, but is technically an SDO. 

[[Centaur (planetoid)|The centaurs]], which are not normally considered part of the Kuiper belt, are also believed to be scattered Kuiper belt objects, the only difference being that they were scattered inward, rather than outward. The [[Minor Planet Center]] groups the centaurs and the SDOs together as scatterd KBOs.&lt;ref name=scattered /&gt;

=== Triton ===
During its period of migration, Neptune is thought to have captured one of the larger KBOs and set it in orbit around itself. This is its moon [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], which is the only large moon in the Solar System to have a [[retrograde orbit]]; it orbits in the opposite direction to Neptune's rotation. This suggests that, unlike the large moons of Jupiter and Saturn, which are thought to have coalesced from spinning discs of material encircling their young parent planets, Triton was a fully formed body that was captured from surrounding space. Gravitational capture of an object is not easy; it requires that some force act upon the object to slow it down enough to be snared by the larger object's gravity. How this happened to Triton is not well understood, though it does suggest that Triton formed as part of a large population of similar objects whose gravity could impede its motion enough to be captured. Spectral analysis of both Triton and Pluto shows that they are largely composed of similar materials, such as [[methane]] and [[carbon monoxide]]. All this points to the conclusion that Triton was once a KBO that was captured by Neptune during its outward migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TRITON, PLUTO, CENTAURS, AND TRANS-NEPTUNIAN BODIES|author=DALE P. CRUIKSHANK|work=NASA Ames Research Center|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/AJ/journal/issues/v123n5/201501/201501.text.html?erFrom=-263003994056677500Guest|year=2004|accessdate=2007-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Satellites===
Satellites are markedly common among trans-Neptunian objects. Of the four largest TNOs, three (Eris, Pluto, and [[2003 EL61]]) possess satellites, and two have more than one. This ratio is higher than that of Kuiper belt satellites as a whole, suggesting that a different formation mechanism was responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Satellites of the Largest Kuiper Belt Objects|author=M.

Wizinowich|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/resolve?id=doi:10.1086/501524|year=2006|accessdate=2007-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also a high number of binaries (two objects close enough in mass to be orbiting &quot;each other&quot;) in the Kuiper belt. The most notable example is the Pluto-Charon binary, but it is estimated that over 1 percent of KBOs (a high percentage) exist in binaries.&lt;ref name=binary&gt;{{cite web|title=Binary Kuiper Belt Objects|author=Dave Jewitt|url=http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~jewitt/kb/binaries.html|year=2005|accessdate=2007-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comets===
{{main|Comet}}
[[Image:Tempel 1 Deep Impact 5min.jpg|thumb|200 px|Comet [[Tempel 1]], a Jupiter-family comet]]
Comets in the solar system can be loosely divided into two categories: short-period and long period. Long period comets are believed to originate in the [[Oort cloud]]. There are two recognised categories of short-period comets: Jupiter-family comets and Halley-family comets. The latter group, which is named for its prototype, [[Halley's Comet]], are believed to have emerged from the Oort cloud but to have been drawn into the inner Solar System by the gravity of the giant planets.&lt;ref name=matter /&gt; It is the former type, the Jupiter family, that are believed to have originated from the Kuiper belt. The centaurs are thought to be a dynamically intermediate stage between the Kuiper belt and the Jupiter family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Populations of Comet-like Bodies in the Solar System|author=J Horner, NW Evans, ME Bailey, DJ Asher|url=http://star.arm.ac.uk/preprints/396.pdf|year=2003|accessdate=2007-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Despite the fact that many are universally thought to have hailed from the Kuiper belt, there exist a wide array of differences between KBOs and Jupiter-family comets. Although the centaurs share a reddish colouration with many KBOs, the nuclei of comets are far bluer, indicating a fundamental chemical or physical difference.&lt;ref name=matter /&gt; The current hypothesis is that comet nuclei are resurfaced as they approach the Sun by subsurface materials which subsequently bury the older reddish material.&lt;ref name= matter /&gt;

==Composition==
[[Image:2003 UB313 near-infrared spectrum.gif|thumb|300 px|The infrared spectra of both Eris and Pluto, highlighting their common methane absorption lines]]

Studies of the Kuiper belt since its discovery have generally indicated that its members are primarily composed of ices; a mixture of light hydrocarbons (such as [[methane]]), [[ammonia]], and water [[ice]], a composition they share with [[comets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=COMPOSITION OF THE VOLATILE MATERIAL IN HALLEY’S COMA FROM IN SITU MEASUREMENTS|author=K.

Jewitt &amp; Jane Luu|url=http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~jewitt/papers/50000/Quaoar.pdf|year=2004|accessdate=2007-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; so many compounds that would remain gaseous closer to the Sun are solid. 
 
Due to their small size and extreme distance from Earth, the chemical makeup of KBOs is very difficult to determine. The principal method by which astronomers determine the composition of a celestial object is [[spectroscopy]]. When an object's light is broken into its component colours, an image akin to a rainbow is formed. This image is called a [[spectrum]]. Different substances absorb light at different wavelengths, and when the spectrum for a specific object is unravelled, dark lines (called [[absorption line]]s) appear where the substances within it have absorbed that particular wavelength of light. Every [[element (chemistry)|element]] or [[compound (chemistry)|compound]] has its own unique spectroscopic signiture, and by reading an object's full spectral &quot;fingerprint&quot;, astronomers can determine what it is made of.

Initially, such detailed analysis of KBOs was impossible, and so astronomers were only able to determine the most basic facts about their makeup, primarily their colour.&lt;ref name=KBOKBO&gt;{{cite web|title=Surfaces of Kuiper Belt Objects|author=Dave Jewitt|work=University of Hawaii|url=http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~jewitt/kb/kb-colors.html|year=2004|accessdate=2007-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; These first data showed a broad range of colours among KBOs, ranging from neutral grey to deep red.&lt;ref name=colour&gt;{{cite web|title=OPTICAL-INFRARED SPECTRAL DIVERSITY IN THE KUIPER BELT|author=DAVID JEWITT, JANE LUU|work=University of Hawaii, Harvard University|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/AJ/journal/issues/v115n4/970453/970453.html|year=1997|accessdate=2007-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This suggested that their surfaces were composed of a wide range of compounds, from dirty ices to hydrocarbons.&lt;ref name=colour /&gt; This diversity was startling, as astronomers had expected KBOs to be uniformly dark, having lost most of their volatile ices to the effects of cosmic rays.&lt;ref&gt;Davies p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; Various solutions were suggested for this discrepency, including resurfacing by impacts or outgassing.&lt;ref name=KBOKBO /&gt; However, Jewitt and Luu's spectral analysis of the known Kuiper belt objects in 2001 found that the variation in colour was too extreme to be easily explained by random impacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=COLORS AND SPECTRA OF KUIPER BELT OBJECTS|author=David C.

Although to date most KBOs still appear spectrally featureless due to their faintness, there have been a number of successes in determining their composition.&lt;ref name=Quaoar /&gt; In 1996, Robert H. Brown ''et al'' obtained spectroscopic data on the KBO 1993 SC, revealing its surface composition to be markedly similar to that of [[Pluto]], as well as Neptune's moon [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], possessing large amounts of [[methane]] ice.&lt;ref name=rbrown&gt;{{cite web|title=Surface Composition of Kuiper Belt Object 1993SC|author=Robert H.

Both of these substances would have been destroyed over the age of the solar system, suggesting that Quaoar had been recently resurfaced, either by internal tectonic activity or by meteorite impacts.&lt;ref name=Quaoar /&gt;

== Mass and size distribution ==
Despite its vast extent, the collective mass of the Kuiper belt is relatively low; estimated at roughly a tenth the mass of the Earth.&lt;ref name=beyond /&gt; Conversely, models of the Solar System's formation predict a collective mass for the Kuiper belt of 30 Earth masses.&lt;ref name=beyond /&gt; This missing &gt;99% of the mass can be hardly dismissed, as it is required for the accretion of any KBOs larger than 100&amp;nbsp;km in diameter. At the current low density these objects simply should not exist. Moreover, the eccentricity and inclination of current orbits makes the encounters quite &quot;violent,&quot; resulting in destruction rather than accretion. 
It appears that either the current residents of the Kuiper belt have been created closer to the Sun or some mechanism dispersed the original mass. Neptune’s influence is too weak to explain such a massive &quot;vacuuming&quot;. While the question remains open, the conjectures vary from a passing star scenario to grinding of smaller objects, via collisions, into dust small enough to be affected by solar radiation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morbidelli 2005&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Bright objects are rare compared with the dominant dim population, as expected from accretion models of origin, given that only some objects of a given size would have grown further. This relationship N(D), the population expressed as a function of the diameter, referred to as brightness slope, has been confirmed by observations. The slope is inversely proportional to some power of the diameter D. 
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d N}{d D} \sim D^{-q}&lt;/math&gt; where the current measures&lt;ref name=&quot;Bernstein et al 2004&quot;&gt;Bernstein G.M., Trilling D.E., Allen R.L. , Brown K.E , Holman M., Malhotra R. ''The size Distribution of transneptunian bodies.'' The Astronomical Journal, '''128''', 1364-1390. 
[http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/astro-ph/pdf/0308/0308467.pdf preprint on arXiv (pdf)] &lt;/ref&gt; give q = 4 ±0.5.

Less formally, there is for instance 8 (=2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) times more objects in 100-200&amp;nbsp;km range than objects in 200-400&amp;nbsp;km range. In other words, for a single object with the diameter of 1000&amp;nbsp;km it should be there around 1000 (=10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) objects with diameter of 100&amp;nbsp;km.

The law is expressed in this differential form rather than as a cumulative cubic relationship, because only the middle part of the slope can be measured; the law must break at smaller sizes, beyond the current measure.

Of course, only the magnitude is actually known, the size is inferred assuming albedo (not a safe assumption for larger objects)
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

==Other Kuiper belts==
[[Image:Kuiper belt remote.jpg|thumb|250px|The debris disks around two remote stars]]
As of 2006, nine stars other than the Sun are known to be circled by Kuiper belt-like structures. They appear to fall into two categories: wide belts, with radii of over 50 AU, and narrow belts (like our own Kuiper belt) with diameters of between 20 and 30 AU with relatively sharp boundaries. Most debris discs around other stars are fairly young, but the two imaged at right, taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in January, 2006, are old enough (roughly 300 million years) to have settled into stable configurations. The left image is a &quot;top view&quot; of a wide belt, and the right image is an &quot;edge view&quot; of a narrow belt. The black central circle is produced by the camera's [[coronagraph]] which hides the central star to allow the much fainter disks to be seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dusty Planetary Disks Around Two Nearby Stars Resemble Our Kuiper Belt|url=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2006/05/image/a|year=2006|accessdate=2007-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

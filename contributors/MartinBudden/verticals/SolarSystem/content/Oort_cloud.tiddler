The '''Oort cloud''', ([[IPA chart for English|IPA]]: [[British English|BrE]] {{IPA|/ɔːt klaʊd/}}, [[American English|AmE]] {{IPA|/ɔɹt klaʊd/}}), alternatively termed the '''Öpik-Oort Cloud''' ({{IPA|/ˈøpik/}}-, like {{IPA|/ˈepik/}} with a rounded /e/), is a postulated  [[sphere|spherical]] cloud of [[comet]]s situated about [[1 E15 m|50]] to [[1 E16 m|50,000]] [[astronomical unit|AU]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Morbidelli2006&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Origin and dynamical evolution of comets and their reservoirs||author=Alessandro Morbidelli|url=http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0512256|year=2006|accessdate=2007-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  from the [[Sun]]. This is approximately 1000 times the distance from the Sun to [[Pluto (planet)|Pluto]] or nearly a [[light year]]. The outer extent of the Oort cloud places the boundary of our Solar System at nearly a quarter of the distance to [[Proxima Centauri]], the nearest star to the Sun. 

Although no confirmed direct observations of the Oort cloud have been made, astronomers believe it to be the source of all long period and [[Halley comet|Halley-type]] [[comet]]s entering the inner [[solar system]] (some short-period [[comet]]s, based on their orbits, may come from the [[Kuiper belt]]).&lt;ref name=Morbidelli2006/&gt; 

==Hypothesis==
In [[1932]] [[Ernst Öpik]], an [[Estonia|Estonian]] astronomer, proposed&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Julius Öpik|Öpik, E.]], ''Note on Stellar Perturbations of Nearby Parabolic Orbits'', Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Vol. 67, pp. 169-182 (1932)&lt;/ref&gt; that comets originate in an orbiting cloud situated at the outermost edge of the solar system. In [[1950]] the idea was revived independently&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Oort|Oort, J. H.]], ''The structure of the cloud of comets surrounding the Solar System and a hypothesis concerning its origin'', Bull. Astron. Inst. Neth., ''11'', p. 91-110 (1950) [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1950BAN....11...91O&amp;amp;data_type=PDF_HIGH&amp;amp;type=PRINTER&amp;amp;filetype=.pdf  Text at Harvard server (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[the Netherlands|Dutch]] astronomer [[Jan Oort|Jan Hendrik Oort]] to explain an apparent contradiction: comets are destroyed by several passes through the inner solar system, yet if the comets we observe had really existed for billions of years (since the origin of the solar system), all would have been destroyed by now. According to the hypothesis, the Oort cloud contains trillions of comet nuclei, which are stable because the sun's radiation is very weak at their distance. The cloud provides a continual supply of new comets, replacing those that are destroyed. In order for it to supply the necessary volume of comets, the total mass of comets in the Oort cloud must be many times that of Earth.

==Structure and composition==
The Oort cloud is thought to occupy a vast space from the outer boundary of the [[Kuiper belt]] at 50 AU to as far as 50,000 AU from the Sun. It can be subdivided into spherical '''outer Oort cloud''' (20,000-50,000 AU) and doughnut-shaped '''inner Oort cloud''' (50-20,000 AU). The outer cloud is only weakly bound to the Sun and supplies the long period (and possibly [[Halley comet|Halley-type]]) [[comet]]s to the inner part of the [[Solar System]].&lt;ref name=Morbidelli2006/&gt; The inner Oort cloud is also known as the '''[[Hills cloud]]''', and may be the source of [[Halley comet|Halley-type]] comets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Origin of Halley-Type Comets: Probing the Inner Oort Cloud|author=Harold F. Levison, Luke Dones, Martin J. Duncan|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001AJ....121.2253L|year=2001|accessdate=2007-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Some scientists think that the Hills cloud may contain much more material than the outer cloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Jack G. Hills| last=Hills| first= J.

The outer Oort cloud is commonly thought to contain several trillion individual comet nuclei larger than ~1.3 km,&lt;ref name=Morbidelli2006/&gt; each tens of millions of kilometers apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Oort Cloud|author=PAUL R.

Earlier it was thought to be more massive (up to 380 Earth masses).&lt;ref name=mass&gt;{{cite web|title=(meteorobs) Excerpts from &quot;CCNet 19/2001|url=http://www.meteorobs.org/maillist/msg20864.html|year=2001|accessdate=2007-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the improved knowledge about the size distribution of the long period comets led to much lower values. The mass of the inner Oort cloud is not currently known.

The vast majority of Oort cloud objects are believed to consist of various ices, but the discovery of the object 1996 PW suggests that it may also be home to rocky objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Origin and Evolution of the Unusual Object 1996 PW: Asteroids from the Oort Cloud?|author=PAUL R. WEISSMAN, HAROLD F. LEVISON|work=Earth and Space Sciences Division, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Space Sciences Department, Southwest Research Institute|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/ApJ/journal/issues/ApJL/v488n2/975490/975490.html|year=1997|accessdate=2007-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The Oort cloud is thought to be a remnant of the original [[protoplanetary disc]] that [[Formation and evolution of the solar system|formed around the Sun approximately 4.6 billion years ago]].&lt;ref name=Morbidelli2006/&gt; Its outer part is only loosely bound to the solar system, and thus easily affected by the motions of passing stars or other forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Oort cloud|url=http://home.xtra.co.nz/hosts/Wingmakers/The%20Oort%20Cloud.html|accessdate=2007-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most widely-accepted hypothesis of its formation is that the Oort cloud's objects initially formed much closer to the [[Sun]] as part of the same process that formed the [[planet]]s and [[asteroid]]s, but that gravitational interaction with young gas giants such as Jupiter ejected them into extremely long [[elliptical orbit|elliptical]] or [[parabolic orbit]]s.&lt;ref name=Morbidelli2006/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oort Cloud &amp; Sol b?|work=SolStation|url=http://www.solstation.com/stars/oort.htm|accessdate=2007-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The current mass of the cloud (about 3 Earth masses) is only a small part of the mass of ejected material (50-100 Earth masses).&lt;ref name=Morbidelli2006/&gt; While on the distant outer regions of these orbits, gravitational interaction with nearby stars and galactical tides further modified their orbits to make them more circular. This explains a near spherical shape of the outer Oort cloud. On the other hand the [[Hills cloud]], being bound stronger to the Sun, hasn't acquired spherical shape yet. Recent studies have shown that the formation of the Oort cloud is broadly compatible with the hypothesis that the [[Solar System]] formed as part of an embedded cluster among between 200 and 400 stars. These early stars likely played a role in the cloud's formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Embedded star clusters and the formation of the Oort Cloud|author=R. Brasser, M. J. Duncan,  H.F. Levison| url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006Icar..184...59B|year=2006|accessdate=2007-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Star perturbations and Nemesis theory==
It is thought that other [[star]]s are likely to possess Oort clouds of their own, and that the outer edges of two nearby stars' Oort clouds may sometimes overlap, causing perturbations in the comets' orbits and thereby increasing the number of comets that enter the inner solar system. The interactions of the Oort cloud with those of neighboring stars, and its deformation by the [[galactic tide]] are thought to be the main triggers which send the long-period comets into the inner [[Solar System]].&lt;ref name=Morbidelli2006/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Oort Cloud|author=Rosanna L. Hamilton|url=http://solarviews.com/eng/oort.htm |year=1999|accessdate=2007-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process also serves to scatter the objects out of the ecliptic plane, explaining the cloud's spherical distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evolution of the Oort Cloud and Distribution of New Comets Due to the Galactic Tide|author=A. Higuchi, E. Kokubo|work=National Astronomical Observatory of Japan| url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006IAUS..236E..57H|year=2006|accessdate=2007-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=algol&gt;{{cite web|title=Close Approaches of Stars to the Oort Cloud: Algol and Gliese 710|author=L. A. Molnar, R. L. Mutel|work=University of Iowwa|url=http://www.aas.org/publications/baas/v29n5/aas191/abs/S069006.html|accessdate=2007-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The known star with the greatest possibility of perturbing the Oort cloud in the next 10 million years is [[Gliese 710]].&lt;ref name=algol /&gt; However, physicist [[Richard A. Muller]] and others have postulated that the [[Sun]] has a heretofore undetected companion ([[brown dwarf]] or gaseous giant planet) in an elliptical orbit beyond the Oort cloud. This object, known as [[Nemesis (star)|Nemesis]], is theorized to pass through a portion of the Oort cloud approximately every 26 million years, bombarding the inner [[solar system]] with comets. Although the theory has many proponents, no direct proof of the existence of Nemesis has been found.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | year= 1984| author= J. G. Hills | title=Dynamical constraints on the mass and perihelion distance of Nemesis and the stability of its orbit | work=Nature|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v311/n5987/abs/311636a0.html| accessdate=2006-06-23}} &lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, many argue that a companion star at such a great distance could not have a stable orbit, as it would probably be ejected by perturbations from other stars.

==Oort cloud objects (OCO)==
{{TNO}}
So far, only two objects with orbits which suggest that they may belong to the Oort Cloud have been discovered: [[90377 Sedna]] and [[2000 CR105|2000 CR&lt;sub&gt;105&lt;/sub&gt;]]. Unlike scattered disk objects, their orbits cannot be explained by perturbations of the main known planets and may thus belong to the inner Oort cloud. Their orbits can then be explained by one of two theories. Either these objects were Oort cloud bodies disrupted by the passage of a neaby star close to the solar system,&lt;ref&gt;

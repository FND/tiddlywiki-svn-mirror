[[Image:InnerSolarSystem-en.png|350px|thumb|The main asteroid belt (shown in white) between the orbits of [[Mars]] and [[Jupiter]].]]
The '''asteroid belt''' is the region of the [[Solar System]] located roughly between the orbits of the [[planet]]s [[Mars]] and [[Jupiter]] where 98.5% of the known [[minor planet]] [[orbit]]s can be found.&lt;ref name=&quot;basedon1&quot;&gt;This value was obtained by a simple count up of all bodies in that region using data for 120437 numbered minor planets from the [http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/MPCORB.html Minor Planet Center orbit database], dated [[February 8]], [[2006]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Asteroid]]s, or [[minor planet]]s, are small celestial bodies composed of rock, ice, and some metal that orbit the [[Sun]]. This region is termed the '''main belt''' when contrasted with other concentrations of minor planets, since these may also be termed asteroid belts.

The asteroid belt formed from the primordial [[solar nebula]] as a group of [[planetesimal]]s&amp;mdash;the smaller precursors of the planets. However, [[gravity|gravitational]] perturbations by Jupiter impart too much orbital energy to the bodies in this region for them to [[accretion (astrophysics)|accrete]] into a planet during collisions. Instead, the initial planetesimals have been broken up during the collisions, and the majority of the mass has been lost since the formation of the Solar system from this region. Asteroid orbits continue to be appreciably [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbed]] whenever their period of revolution about the Sun forms an [[orbital resonance]] with Jupiter. At these orbital distances, a [[Kirkwood gap]] occurs as they are swept into different orbits.

The majority of the mass within the main belt is contained in the largest asteroids. The three largest asteroids in the main belt (individually named [[4 Vesta]], [[2 Pallas]] and [[10 Hygiea]]) have mean diameters of more than 400&amp;nbsp;km, while the main belt's only [[dwarf planet]], [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], is about 950&amp;nbsp;km in diameter. Together these four objects make up nearly half of the total mass in the belt.&lt;ref name=Krasinskyetal2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pitjeva2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=halfmass/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jplsbdb&quot;/&gt;
The remainder form a distribution of smaller bodies that range down to the size of a dust grain. The asteroid material is so-thinly distributed, however, that multiple unmanned spacecraft have traversed the belt without incident. Asteroids within the main belt are categorized by their [[spectrum|spectra]], and the majority can be grouped into three basic types: [[carbon]]aceous ([[C-type asteroid|C-type]]), [[silicate]] ([[S-type asteroid|S-type]]), and [[metal]]-rich ([[M-type asteroid|M-type]]). Collisions between large asteroids can form an [[asteroid family]], whose members possess similar orbital characteristics and composition. Collisions also produce a fine dust that forms a major component of the [[zodiacal light]].

==History of observation==
Following the discovery of Uranus in 1781, [[Johann Elert Bode|Johann Bode]] suggested that another planet may orbit in the gap between [[Mars]] and [[Jupiter]]. The dwarf planet [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] was discovered in the location predicted by Bode in 1801.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[Napoleonic wars]] brought the first period of asteroid discovery to a close,&lt;ref name=&quot;serendipity&quot; /&gt; and it would take until 1845 before another asteroid ([[5 Astraea]]) was
discovered. Shortly thereafter, however, new asteroids were found at an increasing rate. By mid-1868, 100 asteroids had been located, and the introduction of [[astrophotography]] in 1891 by [[Max Wolf]] accelerated the rate of discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1866, [[Daniel Kirkwood]] announced the discovery of gaps in the distances of these bodies' orbits from the [[Sun]]. These gaps were located at positions where their period of revolution about the Sun was an integer fraction of Jupiter's orbital period. Kirkwood proposed that the gravitational [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbations]] of Jupiter led to the removal of asteroids from these orbits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The Japanese astronomer [[Kiyotsugu Hirayama]] noticed in 1918 that the orbits of some of the asteroids had similar parameters, forming families or groups. In the 1970s, examination of asteroid colors led to a classification system. The three most common categories were designated [[C-type asteroid|C-type]] ([[carbon]]aceous), [[S-type asteroid|S-type]] ([[Silicate|silicaceous]]) and [[M-type asteroid|M-type]] ([[metal]]lic).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2006 it was announced that a population of [[comet]]s had been discovered within the asteroid belt. It has been suggested that comets such as these may have provided a source of water for the formation of the Earth's oceans. According to some models, there was insufficient [[outgassing]] of water during the Earth's formulative period to form the oceans, requiring the introduction of an external source such as a cometary bombardment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Formation ===
[[Planetary formation]] is thought to have occurred via a process along the lines of the long-standing nebular hypothesis, which states that a cloud of interstellar dust and gas collapsed under the influence of gravity to form a rotating disk of material that then further condensed to form the Sun and planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first few million years of the Solar System's history, an [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] process of sticky collisions caused clumping together of small particles, formation of larger clumps, and the gradual increase of the size of these bodies. Once the objects reached sufficient mass they could draw in other bodies through gravitational attraction, and become known as [[planetesimal]]s. The gravitational accretion of these planetesimals led to the formation of the rocky planets and to the [[gas giant]]s.

In regions where the average velocity of the collisions was too high, the shattering of planetesimals tends to dominate over accretion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

When the orbital period of a planetismal forms an integer fraction of the orbital period of Jupiter, an [[orbital resonance]] occurs that can perturb the object into a different orbit. The region lying between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter contains many strong orbital resonances with Jupiter. As Jupiter migrated inward following its formation, these resonances would have swept across the asteroid belt, dynamically exciting the region's planetismal population in the process&amp;mdash;increasing their velocities relative to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

===Evolution===
The current asteroid belt is believed to contain only a small fraction (by mass) of the primordial asteroid belt. Based on computer simulations, the original asteroid belt may have contained mass equivalent to the Earth. Primarily because of gravitational perturbations, most of this material was ejected from the belt within a period of about a million years of formation, leaving behind less than 0.1% of the original mass.&lt;ref name=&quot;icarus153&quot; /&gt;

Since their formation, the size distribution of the asteroid belt has remained relatively stable. That is, there has not been a significant increase or decrease in the typical dimensions of the main belt asteroids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Hence, the asteroids themselves are not pristine samples of the early Solar System. By contrast, the objects in the outer [[Kuiper belt]] are believed to have experienced much less change since the Solar System's formation. 

The 4:1 [[orbital resonance]] with Jupiter, at a radius 2.06&amp;nbsp; [[astronomical unit|AU]], can be considered the inner boundary of the main belt. Perturbations by Jupiter send bodies straying there onto unstable orbits. Also, most bodies formed inside the radius of this gap were swept up by [[Mars]] (which has an [[aphelion]] out at 1.67&amp;nbsp;A.U.) or ejected by its gravitational perturbations in the early history of the Solar System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Early fifth terrestrial planet theory===
{{main|Fifth planet (hypothetical)}}
{{seealso|Phaeton (hypothetical planet)}}
An early hypothesis, which is no longer favoured by astronomers, was that the asteroids in the asteroid belt are the remnants of a destroyed planet. There are some key problems with this hypothesis. One is the large amount of energy which would be required to achieve this kind of effect. Another is the low combined mass of the current asteroid belt, which has only a small fraction of the mass of the Earth's [[moon]]. Finally, the significant chemical differences between the asteroids is difficult to explain if they come from the same planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

It has also been hypothesized that a [[Planet V|fifth terrestrial planet]] formed among the [[inner planet]]s, but the orbit was destabilized so that it began crossing the inner asteroid belt. As a result of this transition, a number of asteroids would have been ejected from the belt. Later this planet was either absorbed by the Sun or ejected from the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Nonetheless, hundreds of thousands of asteroids are currently known, and the total number ranges in the millions or more, depending on the lower size cutoff that is assumed.

===Composition===
During the early history of the Solar System, minor planets underwent some degree of melting, allowing elements to be partially or completely segregated by mass. Some of the progenitor bodies may even have undergone periods of explosive [[volcanism]] and formed [[magma]] oceans. However, because of the relatively small size of these bodies, this period of melting was necessarily brief (compared to the much larger planets), and had generally ended about 4.5 billion years ago, that is in the first few tens to a hundred million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

This indicates that they are made of materials that have been significantly modified from the primordial Solar System composition. The expected mechanism was melting early in their history, which caused mass differentiation. They have a relatively high albedo, and form about 17% of the total asteroid population.

A third category of asteroids, forming about 10% of the total population, is the [[M-type asteroid|M-type]]. These have a spectrum that resembles metallic iron-nickel, with a white or slightly red appearance and no absorption features in the spectrum. Some M-type asteroids are believed to be formed from the metallic cores of differentiated progenitor bodies that were disrupted through collision. However, there are also some silicate compounds that can produce a similar appearance. Thus, for example, the large M-type asteroid [[22 Kalliope]] does not appear to be primarily composed of metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Kirkwood gaps===
{{main|Kirkwood gap}}
[[Image:Kirkwood Gaps.png|300px|thumb|Distribution of asteroid [[semi-major axis|semi-major axes]] in the &quot;core&quot; of the main belt. Cyan arrows point to the Kirkwood gaps, where [[orbital resonance]]s with [[Jupiter]] destabilize orbits.]]
The [[semi-major axis]] of an asteroid is used to describe the dimensions of its orbit around the Sun, and its value determines the minor planet's [[orbital period]]. When considering the semi-major axes of all asteroids, the main belt contains noticeable gaps, called [[Kirkwood gaps]], in its distribution. They occur at the radii at which the mean orbital period of an asteroid is an integer fraction of the orbital period of Jupiter. This results in [[mean-motion resonance]] with the [[gas giant]] that is sufficient to perturb an asteroid to new [[orbital element]]s. In effect, asteroids located in such gap orbits are gradually nudged into different, random orbits with a larger or smaller semi-major axis. 

However, the gaps are not seen in a simple snapshot of the locations of the asteroids at any one time. This is because asteroid orbits are elliptical, and many asteroids still cross through the radii corresponding to the gaps. The actual spatial density of asteroids in these gaps is not significantly different than in the neighboring regions.&lt;ref name=&quot;mnras244&quot; /&gt;

The main gaps occur at the 3:1, 5:2, 7:3 and 2:1 mean-motion resonances with Jupiter. Thus an asteroid in the 3:1 Kirkwood gap would orbit the Sun three times for each Jovian orbit. Weaker resonances occur at other values of semi-major axis, such that less asteroids are found with those values than with nearby ones. (For example, a 8:3 resonance for asteroids with a semi-major axis of 2.71 A.U.)&lt;ref name=&quot;iau160&quot;&gt;{{cite conference

The main or &quot;core&quot; population of the asteroid belt is sometimes divided into three zones, based on the most prominent Kirkwood gaps. Zone I lies between the 4:1 resonance (2.06 A.U.) and 3:1 resonance (2.5 A.U.) Kirkwood gaps. Zone II contines from the end of Zone I out to the 5:2 resonance gap (2.82 A.U.). Zone III runs from the outer edge of Zone II to the 2:1 resonance gap (3.28 A.U.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Klacka

The main belt may also be divided into the inner and outer belts, with the inner belt formed by asteroids orbiting nearer to Mars than the 3:1 Kirkwood gap (2.5&amp;nbsp;A.U.), and the outer belt formed by those asteroids closer to Jupiter's orbit. (Some authors subdivide the inner and outer belts at the 2:1 resonance gap [3.3 A.U.], while others even define inner, middle and outer belts.)

===Collisions===
Measurements of the rotation periods of large asteroids in the main belt show that there is a lower limit. No asteroid with a diameter larger than 100 metres has a period of rotation of less than 2.2 hours. For asteroids rotating faster than approximately this rate, the [[centrifugal force]] at the surface is greater than the [[gravitational force]], so any loose surface material would be flung out. However, a solid object should be able to rotate much more rapidly. This suggests that the majority of asteroids with a diameter over 100 metres are actually [[rubble pile]]s formed through accumulation of debris after collisions between asteroids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The high population of the main belt makes for a very active environment, where collisions between asteroids occur frequently (on astronomical time scales). Collisions between main belt bodies with a mean radius of 10-km are expected to occur about once every 10 million years.&lt;ref name=&quot;backman_report&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collisions that occur at low relative speeds may even join two asteroids together. After more than 4 billion years of such processes, the members of the asteroid belt now bear little resemblance to the original population.

In addition to the asteroid bodies, the main belt also contains bands of dust with particle radii of up to a few hundred [[micrometre]]s. This fine material is produced, at least in part, from collisions between asteroids, and by the impact of micrometeorites upon the asteroids. Due to [[Poynting-Robertson effect|Poynting-Robertson drag]], the pressure of [[solar radiation]] causes this dust to slowly spiral inward toward the [[Sun]].&lt;ref name=&quot;apj392&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

The combination of this fine asteroid dust, as well as ejected cometary material, produces the [[zodiacal light]]. This faint auroral glow can be viewed at night extending from the direction of the [[Sun]] along the plane of the [[ecliptic]]. Particles that produce the visible zodiacal light average about 40 Œºm in radius. The typical lifetimes of such particles is on the order of 700,000 years. Thus, in order to maintain the bands of dust, new particles must be steadily produced within the asteroid belt.&lt;ref name=&quot;apj392&quot; /&gt;

Approximately one third of the asteroids in the main belt are members of an asteroid family. These are asteroids that share similar [[orbital elements]], such as [[semimajor axis]], [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]], and orbital [[inclination]] as well as similar spectral features, all of which indicate a common origin in the breakup of a larger body. Graphical displays of these elements, for members of the main belt, show concentrations indicating the presence of an asteroid family. There are about 20&amp;ndash;30 associations that are almost certainly asteroid families, and likely have a common origin. Additional groupings have been found but these are less certain. Asteroid families can be confirmed when the members display common spectral features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

===Periphery===
Skirting the inner edge of the belt (ranging between 1.78 and 2.0 A.U. with a mean semi-major axis of 1.9 A.U.) is the [[Hungaria family]] of minor planets. They are named after the main member of this family&amp;mdash;[[434 Hungaria]], and the group contains at least 52 named asteroids. The Hungaria group are separated from the main body by the 4:1 Kirkwood gap and their orbits have a high inclination. Some members of this group belong to the Mars-crossing category of asteroids, and gravitational perturbations by Mars is a likely factor in reducing the total population of this group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Skirting the outer edge of the main belt is the [[65 Cybele|Cybele group]], orbiting between 3.3 and 3.5 A.U. These have a 7:4 orbital resonance with Jupiter. The [[Hilda family]] orbit between 3.5 and 4.2 A.U., and have relatively circular orbits and a stable 3:2 orbital resonance with Jupiter. There are relatively few asteroids beyond 4.2 A.U., until reaching Jupiter's orbit. Here the two large groups of [[Trojan asteroid]]s can be found, although they are not usually considered part of the main asteroid belt.

The first spacecraft to traverse the asteroid belt was [[Pioneer 10]], after entering the belt region on [[July 16]], [[1972]]. At the time there was some concern that the debris in the belt would pose a hazard to the spacecraft. Since that time though the belt has been safely traversed by the [[Pioneer 11]], [[Voyager program|Voyagers 1 and 2]], [[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]], [[Cassini‚ÄìHuygens|Cassini]], [[NEAR Shoemaker|NEAR]], [[Ulysses probe|Ulysses]] and [[New Horizons]] spacecraft, without incident.

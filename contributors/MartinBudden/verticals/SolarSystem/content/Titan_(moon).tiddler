'''Titan''' ({{IPA|/ˈtaɪ.tən/}}, from [[Ancient Greek]] Τῑτάν) or '''Saturn VI''' is the largest [[natural satellite|moon]] of [[Saturn]] and the [[List of natural satellites by diameter|second largest moon]] in the [[Solar System]],&lt;ref Name=NasaNews&gt;[http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/features/saturn-story/moons.cfm NASA page: News-Features-the Story of Saturn] saturn.jpl.nasa.gov. Retrieved [[8 January]] [[2007]].&lt;/ref&gt; after [[Jupiter|Jupiter's]] moon [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]]. It is roughly 50% larger than [[Moon|Earth's moon]] by diameter, and is larger by diameter and mass than all known [[dwarf planet]]s. It is also larger by diameter than the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], though Mercury is more than twice as [[mass]]ive. It was discovered on [[March 25]], [[1655]], by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] astronomer [[Christiaan Huygens]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/science/titan.cfm NASA page: The Story of Saturn/The moons] ''&quot;On March 24, 1655, ... The next day, Christiaan Huygens ... discovered its largest moon, Titan.&quot;'' States the date of discovery. Retrieved [[29 March]] [[2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; and was the first of Saturn's moons to be discovered. 

Titan is the only moon in our solar system to have a dense [[celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]].&lt;ref Name=NasaNews/&gt; Until 2004, this atmosphere prevented understanding of Titan's surface, but with the arrival of  the ''[[Cassini-Huygens]]'' mission, new information about it has accumulated, such as the discovery of liquid [[hydrocarbon]] lakes near its north pole. These are the only large, stable bodies of surface liquid known to exist anywhere other than [[Earth]].

Titan is never visible to the naked eye, but can be observed through small telescopes (diameter greater than 5&amp;nbsp;cm) or strong binoculars. It has a maximum [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] of +7.9, outshone by six [[asteroid]]s ([[4 Vesta|Vesta]], [[2 Pallas|Pallas]], [[7 Iris|Iris]], [[6 Hebe|Hebe]], [[3 Juno|Juno]], [[18 Melpomene|Melpomene]]) and the dwarf planet [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]]. Titan reaches an angular distance of about 20 Saturn radii from Saturn and subtends a disk 0.8&amp;nbsp;[[arcsecond]]s in diameter.

==Name==
Huygens named his discovery simply ''Saturni Luna'' (Latin for &quot;Saturn's moon,&quot; which can also be written ''Luna Saturni'') (''De Saturni Luna observatio nova'', 1656; XV). Later, [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]] named the four moons he discovered ([[Tethys (moon)|Tethys]], [[Dione (moon)|Dione]], [[Rhea (moon)|Rhea]] and [[Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]]) ''[[Sidera Lodoicea]]'' (&quot;the stars of Louis&quot;) to honour king [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]. Astronomers fell into the habit of referring to them as ''Saturn&amp;nbsp;I'' through ''Saturn&amp;nbsp;V''. Other epithets used were &quot;Saturn's ordinary satellite&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0370-2316%281673%298%3C5178%3AADOTNP%3E2.0.CO%3B2-Z ''A Discovery of two'' New Planets ''about'' Saturn, ''made in the Royal Parisian Observatory by Signor'' Cassini, ''Fellow of both the Royal Societys, of'' England ''and'' France; ''English't out of French.''], Philosophical Transactions 8 (1673), pp. 5178-5185.&lt;!--- This journal became the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London in 1775. There may just be earlier publications within the ''[[Journal des sçavans]].---&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the &quot;Huygenian satellite of Saturn&quot; (or &quot;Huyghenian&quot;), or the &quot;sixth satellite of Saturn&quot; ('''Saturn&amp;nbsp;VI''', still in use) (in order of distance from Saturn, once [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]] and [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]] were also discovered in 1789).

The name &quot;Titan&quot; and the names of all seven satellites of Saturn then known come from [[John Herschel]] (son of [[William Herschel]], discoverer of Mimas and Enceladus) in his 1847 publication ''Results of Astronomical Observations made at the Cape of Good Hope'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/MNRAS/0008//0000042.000.html Satellites of Saturn; Observations of Mimas, the closest and most interior satellite of Saturn], Mr Lassell, Monthly Notices of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]], volume 8, page 42, 1847-11-12. Retrieved [[29 March]] [[2005]].&lt;/ref&gt; wherein he suggested the names of the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]], sisters and brothers of [[Cronus|Cronos]] (the Greek Saturn), be used.

At 5,150&amp;nbsp;km across, Titan is larger than the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and is the second largest natural satellite in the solar system after Ganymede.&lt;ref&gt;*Bill Arnett (2005). [http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/titan.html Titan]. Retrieved [[10 April]] [[2005]]. &quot;Titan is nevertheless larger in diameter than Mercury&quot;; &quot;It was long thought that Titan was the largest satellite in the solar system but recent observations have shown that Titan's atmosphere is so thick that its solid surface is slightly smaller than Ganymede's.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the arrival of ''[[Voyager 1]]'' in 1980, Titan was thought to be slightly larger than Ganymede, an error resulting from the haze in its atmosphere which extends around 880&amp;nbsp;[[kilometre|km]] above the surface and is almost opaque to [[Visible spectrum|visible light]].&lt;ref&gt;Mori K., Tsunemi H., Katayama H., Burrows D.N., Garmire G.P., Metzger A.E.

===Internal structure===
[[Image:Titan cutaway NASA.jpg|thumb|Titan's internal structure.|left]]&lt;!--PLEASE KEEP ON THE LEFT TO NOT HAMPER THE LAYOUT OF ARTICLE..--&gt;
Titan's diameter and mass (and thus its density) are similar to Jovian moons Ganymede and [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]].&lt;ref name=LunineAstro&gt;Lunine, J. &quot;[http://www.astrobio.net/news/article1493.html Comparing the Triad of Great Moons.]&quot; ''Astrobiology Magazine'': [[2005-03-21]]. Retrieved [[2006-07-20]].&lt;/ref&gt; Based on its bulk density of 1.88&amp;nbsp;g/cm³, Titan's bulk composition is half water ice and half rocky material. It is probably differentiated into several layers with a 3400&amp;nbsp;km (2,040 mi) rocky center surrounded by several layers composed of different crystal forms of ice.&lt;ref name=Tobie&gt;{{cite journal | author = G. Tobie, O. Grasset, J. I. Lunine, A. Mocquet, C.

Though similar in composition to [[Rhea (moon)|Rhea]] and the rest of Saturn's moons, it is denser due to [[gravitational compression]].

===Atmosphere===
[[Image:Titan-Complex 'Anti-greenhouse'.jpg|thumb|right|True-color image of layers of haze in Titan's atmosphere.]]
Titan is the only known moon with a fully developed [[atmosphere]] that consists of more than just [[trace gas]]es. The presence of a significant atmosphere was first discovered by [[Gerard P. Kuiper]] in 1944 using a [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic technique]] that yielded an estimate of an atmospheric [[partial pressure]] of [[methane]] of the order of 100 millibars (10 kPa).&lt;ref name=Kuiper&gt;{{cite journal|author= G. P. Kuiper|year= 1944 | url= http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1944ApJ...100..378|title = Titan: a Satellite with an Atmosphere | journal =Astrophysical Journal|voulme = 100 |pages = 378| doi =10.1086/144679}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, observations from [[Voyager program|''Voyager'']] [[space probe]]s have shown that the Titanian atmosphere is denser than [[Earth]]'s, with a surface pressure more than one and a half times that of our planet, and supports an opaque cloud layer that obscures Titan's surface features at visible wavelengths. The [[haze]] that can be seen in the picture to the right contributes to the moon's [[Anti-Greenhouse Effect]] and lowers the temperature by reflecting sunlight away from the satellite. The thick atmosphere blocks most visible wavelength light from the Sun and other sources from reaching Titan's surface. It is so thick, in fact, and the gravity is so low, that humans could fly through it by flapping &quot;wings&quot; attached to their arms.&lt;ref name=Zubrin&gt;Robert Zubrin, Entering Space: Creating a Spacefaring Civilization, section: Titan, pp. 163-166, Tarcher/Putnam, 1999, ISBN 1-58542-036-0&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Huygens probe|''Huygens'' probe]] was unable to detect the direction of the Sun during its descent, and although it was able to take images from the surface, scientists say the process was like photographing [[asphalt]] at dusk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/titan_update_050121.html Huygens Probe Sheds New Light on Titan], Petre de Selding, Space News, [[21 January]] [[2005]], verified [[28 March]] [[2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The atmosphere is 98.4% [[nitrogen]]&amp;mdash;the only dense nitrogen-rich atmosphere in the solar system aside from our own&amp;mdash;with the remaining 1.6% composed of [[methane]] and only trace amounts of other gases such as hydrocarbons (including [[ethane]], [[diacetylene]], [[methylacetylene]], [[cyanoacetylene]], [[acetylene]], [[propane]]), [[argon]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[cyanogen]], [[hydrogen cyanide]] and [[helium]].&lt;ref name=Niemann&gt;{{cite journal | title= The abundances of constituents of Titan’s atmosphere from the GCMS instrument on the Huygens probe |author= H. B. Niemann, S. K. Atreya, S. J. Bauer, G. R. Carignan, J. E. Demick, R. L. Frost, D. Gautier, J. A. Haberman, D. N. Harpold, D. M. Hunten, G. Israel, J. I. Lunine, W. T. Kasprzak, T. C. Owen, M. Paulkovich, F. Raulin, E. Raaen, S. H. Way |journal= [[Nature]] |volume=438 |pages=779-784 |year=2005 |doi=10.1038/nature04122 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The hydrocarbons are thought to form in Titan's upper atmosphere in reactions resulting from the breakup of methane by the [[Sun]]'s [[ultraviolet]] light, producing a thick orange smog. Titan has no [[magnetic field]] and sometimes orbits outside Saturn's [[magnetosphere]], directly exposing it to the [[solar wind]]. This may [[ion]]ize and carry away some molecules from the top of the atmosphere.

The nitrogen ratio of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N to &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N is 183 compared with the Earth's average of 272.&lt;ref name=Niemann/&gt; In the methane the isotope ratio of &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C/&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C is 82.3 compared with the Earth standard of 89.9.&lt;ref name=Niemann/&gt; The isotope ratio of H/D is 3.6 x 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; compared with 3.0 x 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; on Earth. The depletion of the lighter isotope of nitrogen indicates atmospheric escapes whereas the carbon and the hydrogen are far less depleted. The ratio of argon to nitrogen is 100 times less than in Earth's atmosphere.&lt;ref name=Niemann/&gt;

[[Image:Titan's Many Layers.jpg|thumb|left|Layers of haze seen in a colorized ultraviolet image of Titan's night-side limb]]
From all available data several theoretical models and experiments for the development of the Titan atmosphere have been derived. The high UV-radiation and high energy electrons are an energy source for many chemical reactions in the atmosphere. The hydrogen compounds ammonia and methane undergo dehydrogenation, forming complex organic compounds, nitrogen and hydrogen which is lost over cosmological time. The absence of ammonia and the presence of methane, although they should have a similar half life, indicates a source for methane on Titan. [[Clathrates]] (methane incorporated into ice), comets, and a [[Fischer Tropsch]] like synthesis are suggestions for the abundance of methane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title= Formation and evolution of Titan’s atmosphere |author= A. Coustenis |journal= Space Science Reviews |volume= 116 |pages= 171 – 184 |year= 2005 |doi= 10.1007/s11214-005-1954-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent flyby has suggested the existence of a large cloud over Titan's north pole, existing at a height of 40&amp;nbsp;km. At this altitude it is cold enough for ethane to freeze and the detected size of these particles is only 1-3 microns, suggesting again ethane, rather than methane which is also known to condense in the atmosphere of Titan. The downdrafts at high northern latitudes are strong enough to drive these particles towards the surface. A theory is that it is currently raining (or if cool enough, snowing) on the north pole. When the seasons switch, ethane will begin to condense over the south pole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title= Huge ethane cloud discovered on Titan |author= David Shiga |journal= New Scientist |volume= 313 |pages= 1620, |year= 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simulations of global wind patterns based on wind speed data taken by Huygens during its descent have suggested that Titan's atmosphere circulates in a single enormous [[Hadley cell]]. Warm air rises in Titan's southern hemisphere - experiencing summer during Huygens' descent - and sinks in the northern hemisphere, resulting in high-altitude air flow from south to north and low-altitude airflow from north to south. Such a large Hadley cell is only possible on a slowly rotating world such as Titan. There was also a pattern of air circulation flowing in the direction of Titan's rotation, from west to east.&lt;ref name=&quot;Titan wind&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title=The Way the Wind Blows on Titan|date=June 01, 2007| url=http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/features/feature20070601f.cfm| accessdate=2007-06-02| publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural [[extremely low frequency|ELF]] radio waves have been tentatively identified by Cassini in Titan's atmosphere. Titan's surface is thought to be a poor reflector of ELF waves, so they may instead be reflecting off the liquid-ice boundary of a subsurface ocean of water and ammonia predicted by some theoretical models. Titan's ionosphere is also more complex than Earth's, with the main ionosphere at an altitude of 1200 km but with an additional layer of charged particles at 63 km. This splits Titan's atmosphere to some extent into two separate resonating chambers. The source of natural ELF waves on Titan is unclear as there does not appear to be extensive lightning activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Titan ELF&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/features/feature20070601c.cfm| title=Titan's Mysterious Radio Wave| date=June 01, 2007| publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory| accessdate=2007-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
[[Image:Titan-ethane.jpg|thumb|right|Possible cloud of [[ethane]] (red) over Titan's north pole (marked NP)]]
At the surface, Titan's temperature is about 94&amp;nbsp;K (−179&amp;nbsp;°C, or −290.2&amp;nbsp;°F). At this temperature water ice does not [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimate]], so the atmosphere is nearly free of water vapor. Scattered variable clouds punctuate an overall haze in Titan's atmosphere. These clouds are probably composed of methane, ethane or other simple organics. Other more complex chemicals in small quantities must produce the orange color as seen from space.

Ground-based observations show that Titan's climate changes with the seasons. Over the course of Saturn's 30-year orbit, Titan's cloud systems appear to manifest for 25 years, and then fade for four to five years, before reappearing again.&lt;ref name=nasagov&gt;{{cite web|title=Cassini Images Mammoth Cloud Engulfing Titan's North Pole|work=NASA|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/media/cassini-20070201.html|year=2007|accessdate=2007-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The findings of the ''Huygens'' probe indicate that Titan's atmosphere periodically rains liquid methane and other organic compounds onto the moon's surface.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetary.org/news/2005/huygens_science-results_0121.html Titan: Arizona in an Icebox?], Emily Lakdawalla, [[2004-01-21]], verified [[2005-03-28]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that areas of Titan's surface may be coated in a tar-like layer of organic precipitate called [[tholin]], but this has not been confirmed. The presence of [[argon|argon 40]] was also discovered in the atmosphere, evidence of [[Cryovolcano|cryovolcanism]] producing a &quot;lava&quot; of water ice and ammonia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMHB881Y3E_index_0.html Seeing, touching and smelling the extraordinarily Earth-like world of Titan], ESA News, [[European Space Agency]], [[2005-01-21]], verified [[2005-03-28]]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, a methane-spewing volcano was spotted in close-up images, and Titanian volcanism is now believed to be a significant source of the methane in the atmosphere. As of early 2007, liquid methane oceans appear to be present (see section below). This is a departure from the previously accepted theory that such oceans were all but entirely absent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7489 Hydrocarbon volcano discovered on Titan], David L. Chandler, NewScientist.com news service, [[New Scientist]], [[2005-06-08]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The October 2004 [[Cassini-Huygens|''Cassini'']] flyby photographed bright, high clouds at Titan's south pole, but they do not appear to be methane, as had been expected. This discovery has baffled scientists and studies are currently underway to determine the composition of the clouds and decide whether our understanding of Titan's atmosphere needs to be revised.&lt;ref&gt;[http://space.com/scienceastronomy/titan_mysteries_041028.html New Images of Titan Baffle Astronomers], Henry Bortman, Astrobiology Magazine, [[2004-10-28]], verified [[2005-03-28]]&lt;/ref&gt; Observations by ''Cassini'' of the atmosphere made in 2004 suggest that Titan is a &quot;super rotator,&quot; like [[Venus (planet)|Venus]], with an atmosphere that rotates much faster than its surface.
[[Image:Titancloud.jpg|thumb|left|A methane cloud imaged in false colour over Titan's north pole]]
In December 2006, Cassini imaged a large cloud of methane, ethane and other organics over the moon's north pole. The cloud is over 2400&amp;nbsp;km in diameter and was still visible during a following flyby a month later. This cloud likely formed from evaporation from methane lakes recently observed at that pole, which were in turn likely formed by methane rains from the cloud. ([[#Liquids on Titan|see below]]). This is the strongest evidence yet for the long hypothesised &quot;methanological&quot; cycle (analogous to Earth's [[hydrological cycle]]) on Titan.&lt;ref name=nasagov /&gt;

It is currently summer in Titan's southern hemisphere. Southern summer on Titan will last until 2010, when Saturn's orbit, which governs the moon's motion, will tilt the northern hemisphere towards the Sun.&lt;ref name=&quot;Titan wind&quot;/&gt;

===Surface features===

The ''Cassini'' mission has revealed that Titan's surface is relatively smooth. The few objects that seem to be [[impact crater]]s appeared to have been filled in, perhaps by raining hydrocarbons or volcanoes. The area mapped so far appears to have no height variation greater than 50&amp;nbsp;meters (165&amp;nbsp;feet);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99996598 Titan's complex and strange world revealed], Stephen Battersby, NewScientist.com news service, [[New Scientist]], [[2004-10-29]], verified [[2005-03-28]]&lt;/ref&gt; however, radar altimetry has so far only covered part of the north polar region.
[[Image:Titan multi spectral overlay.jpg|thumb|Titan in false color showing surface details and atmosphere. &quot;Xanadu&quot; is the bright region at the centre-right]]
Titan's surface is marked by broad regions of bright and dark terrain. These include a large, highly [[Reflection (physics)|reflective]] area about the size of [[Australia]] identified in [[infrared]] images from the ''[[Hubble Space Telescope]]'' and the ''Cassini'' spacecraft. This region is named [[Xanadu (Titan)|Xanadu]] and appears to represent an area of relatively high ground. There are dark areas of similar size elsewhere on the moon, observed from the ground and by ''Cassini''; it had been speculated that these are [[methane]] or [[ethane]] seas, but ''Cassini'' observations seem to indicate otherwise (see below). ''Cassini'' has also spotted some enigmatic linear markings, which some scientists have suggested may indicate [[tectonic]] activity, as well as regions of bright material cross cut by dark lineaments within the dark terrain.

In order to understand Titanian surface features better, the ''Cassini'' spacecraft is currently using [[radar]] altimetry and [[synthetic aperture radar]] imaging to map portions of Titan during its close fly-bys of the moon. The first images have revealed a complex, diverse geology with both rough and smooth areas. There are features that seem [[Cryovolcanism|volcanic]] in origin, which probably disgorge water mixed with [[ammonia]]. There are also streaky features that appear to be caused by windblown particles.

====Liquids on Titan====
[[Image:PIA09102PIA09102 Liquid Lakes on Titan.jpg|thumb|right|Pseudo-colored radar imaging data from a Cassini flyby of northern lattitudes, published in the journal ''Nature'' to illustrate the convincing evidence for large bodies of liquid. The false blue coloring indicates low radar reflectivity areas, likely caused by liquid.]]

It has long been believed that lakes or even seas of methane might exist on Titan's surface, but until recently, conclusive evidence has proven elusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author= S. F.Dermott, [[Carl Sagan|C. Sagan]], |year=1995| title= Tidal effects of disconnected hydrocarbon seas on Titan
|journal=Nature |volume=374 | pages=238-240}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Cassini]] probe arrived in the Saturnian system, it was hoped that [[hydrocarbon]] lakes or oceans might be detectable by reflected sunlight from the surface of any liquid bodies, but no [[specular reflection]]s were initially observed. ''Cassini'' observed surface features that could be explained as the products of flowing liquids, but again, there were few conclusive observations. 

The first indication of the presence of a lake was observed at Titan's south pole, where clouds have been observed to cluster, and where an enigmatic dark feature at the pole, named [[Ontario Lacus]] was identified as a possible [[lake]] created by precipitation from them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.planetary.org/news/2005/0628_Dark_Spot_Near_the_South_Pole_A.html| title=Dark Spot Near the South Pole:A Candidate Lake on Titan?| publisher=Planetary.org| accessdate=2006-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A possible shoreline has also been identified at the pole via radar imagery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=17829| title=NASA Cassini Radar Images Show Dramatic Shoreline on Titan|date=September 16, 2005| accessdate=2006-10-14| publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, on [[January 3]], [[2007]], it was announced that scientists have &quot;definitive evidence of lakes filled with methane on Saturn's moon Titan.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6230381.stm 'Proof' of methane lakes on Titan] BBC news, [[4 January]] [[2007]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/features/feature20070103.cfm Titan Has Liquid Lakes, Scientists Report in Nature] saturn.jpl.nasa.gov, [[3 January]], [[2007]]. Retrieved [[8 January]] [[2007]].&lt;/ref&gt; The high relative humidity of methane in Titan’s lower atmosphere could be maintained by evaporation from lakes covering only 0.002–0.02 of the whole surface &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author= G. Mitri, [[Giuseppe Mitri|G. Mitri]], |year=2007| title= Hydrocarbon Lakes on Titan |journal=Icarus |volume=186 | pages=385-394}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Following a flyby on [[July 22]], [[2006]], in which the Cassini spacecraft's radar imaged the northern latitudes (which are currently in winter), a number of large, smooth (and thus dark to radar) patches were seen dotting the surface near the pole.&lt;ref name=&quot;PIA08630&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08630| title=PIA08630: Lakes on Titan| publisher=NASA/JPL | accessdate=2006-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cassini-Huygens team have now concluded that these features are almost certainly the long sought hydrocarbon lakes of Titan. Some of the lakes appear to have channels running in or out of them, which are just as smooth. [[Ethane]] and [[methane]] may be liquids near Titan's poles, which are cold enough for these gases to condense. Repeated coverage of these areas should prove whether they are truly liquid, as any changes that correspond with wind blowing on the surface of the liquid would alter the roughness of the surface and be visible in the radar. NASA recently confirmed that there is ice from hydrocarbon rain at the north polar area.
[[Image:TitanSeaComparison.jpg|200px|thumb|left|NASA image comparing a body of liquid on Titan with [[Lake Superior]].]]
[[Image:Huygens shoreline.jpg|thumb|left|Image of Titan taken during [[Huygens probe|Huygens']] descent, showing hills and topographical features that resemble a shoreline and drainage channels.]]
The strongest evidence yet of lakes on Titan came during a Cassini flyby in late February 2007, as observations by the radar and camera instruments revealed several large features in the north polar region that may be large expanses of liquid methane and/or ethane, including one sea with an area of over 100,000&amp;nbsp;square&amp;nbsp;kilometers (larger than [[Lake Superior]]), and another (though less definite) region potentially the size of the [[Caspian Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/media/cassini-20070313.html| title=Cassini Spacecraft Images Seas on Saturn's Moon Titan| date=2007-03-13| accessdate=2007-03-14| publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discoveries at the poles contrast with the findings of the ''[[Huygens probe|Huygens]]'' probe, which landed near Titan's equator on [[January 14]] [[2005]]. The images taken by the probe during its descent show no open areas of liquid, but strongly indicate the presence of liquids in the recent past, showing pale hills crisscrossed with dark drainage channels that lead into a wide, flat, darker region. It was initially thought that the dark region might be a lake of a [[fluid]] or at least [[tar]]ry substance, but it is now clear that ''Huygens'' landed on the dark region, and that it is solid without any indication of liquids. A [[Cone Penetrometer|penetrometer]] studied the composition of the surface as the craft impacted it, and it was initially reported that the surface was similar to loose [[sand]], wet [[clay]], or perhaps [[crème brûlée]] (that is, a hard crust covering a sticky material). However, subsequent analysis of the data suggests that this reading was likely caused by ''Huygens'' displacing a large pebble as it landed, and that the surface is better described as a 'sand' made of ice grains.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4417503.stm Titan probe's pebble 'bash-down'], BBC News, [[10 April]] [[2005]].&lt;/ref&gt; The images taken after the probe's landing show a flat plain covered in pebbles. The pebbles, which may be made of water ice, are somewhat rounded, which may indicate the action of fluids on them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetary.org/news/2005/0115_The_Planetary_Societys_Huygens_Weblog.html New Images from the Huygens Probe: Shorelines and Channels, But an Apparently Dry Surface], Emily Lakdawalla, [[2005-01-15]], verified [[2005-03-28]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Giant Lake on Titan.jpg|thumb|right|A view of Titan centered on the large lake-like feature in Titan's north polar region, which lies just below the day-night line in this image.]]
Since the existence of lakes on Titan has only been recently confirmed, and the hypothesized vast methane oceans have not been found, some scientists now believe that many of the moon's features are caused by [[cryovolcanism]] rather than running liquids. Alternatively, it has been hypothesized that ''Huygens'' landed during a dry season on Titan, and that periods of heavy methane rain could form lakes that subsequently evaporate. The length of the intervals between rainy periods on Titan are unknown, and scientists stress that ''Huygens'' sampled only one small site on this planet-sized moon, which is insufficient for evaluating the entire body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetary.org/news/2005/0121_Titan_Arizona_in_an_Icebox.html Titan: Arizona in an Icebox?], Emily Lakdawalla, [[2004-01-21]], verified [[2005-03-28]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Impact craters====
Radar [[synthetic aperture radar|SAR]] and imaging data from Cassini have revealed a relative paucity of impact craters on Titan's surface, suggesting a youthful surface. To date, only three impact craters have been confirmed, which includes a 440&amp;nbsp;km wide multi-ring impact basin named Menrva (seen by Cassini's ISS as a bright-dark concentric pattern),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07365| title=PIA07365: Circus Maximus| publisher=NASA Planetary Photojournal| accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; a smaller 80&amp;nbsp;km wide flat-floored crater named Sinlap,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07368| title=PIA07368: Impact Crater with Ejecta Blanket| publisher=NASA Planetary Photojournal| accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 30&amp;nbsp;km crater with a central peak and dark floor named [[Ksa (crater)|Ksa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08737| title=PIA08737: Crater Studies on Titan| publisher=NASA Planetary Photojournal| accessdate=2006-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; RADAR and Cassini imaging have also revealed a number of &quot;crateriforms&quot;, circular features on the surface of Titan that may be impact related, but lack certain features that would make identification certain. For example, a 90&amp;nbsp;km wide ring of bright, rough material known as [[Guabonito (Titan)|Guabonito]] has been observed by Cassini.&lt;ref name=Guabonito&gt;{{cite web| url=http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08425| title=PIA08425: Radar Images the Margin of Xanadu| publisher=NASA Planetary Photojournal| accessdate=2006-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This feature is thought to be an impact crater filled-in by dark, windblown sediment. Several other similar features have been observed in the dark Shangri-la and Aaru regions. RADAR observed several circular features that may be craters in the bright region Xanadu during Cassini's [[April 30]], [[2006]] flyby of Titan.&lt;ref name=Xcraters&gt;{{cite web| url=http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08429| title=PIA08429: Impact Craters on Xanadu| publisher=NASA Planetary Photojournal| accessdate=2006-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cryovolcanism====
{{main|Cryovolcano}}
[[Image:Titan surface Radar.jpg|thumb|One of the first [[radar]] images of Titan's complex surface. The circular feature at left, [[Ganesa Macula]], is thought to be a cryovolcanic dome.]]
Scientists have speculated that conditions on Titan resemble those of early Earth, though at a much lower temperature. Evidence of volcanic activity from the latest Cassini mission suggests that temperatures are probably much higher in hotbeds, enough for liquid water to exist. [[Argon|Argon 40]] detection in the atmosphere indicates that volcanoes spew plumes of water and ammonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tobias Owen |title= Planetary science: Huygens rediscovers Titan| journal=Nature| volume=438| pages=756-757| doi=10.1038/438756a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mountains====
A mountain range measuring 150&amp;nbsp;km (93&amp;nbsp;miles) long, 30&amp;nbsp;km (19&amp;nbsp;miles) wide and 1.5&amp;nbsp;km (1&amp;nbsp;mile) high was discovered by Cassini in 2006. This range lies in the southern hemisphere and is thought to be composed of icy material and covered in methane snow. The movement of tectonic plates, perhaps influenced by a nearby impact basin, could have opened a gap through which the mountain's material upwelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6174501.stm|title=Mountain range spotted on Titan |publisher=BBC News|date=[[2006-12-13]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dark terrain====
[[Image:Titan dunes.jpg|thumb|300 px|left|Titan's sand dunes (below), compared with dunes on Earth's surface (above)]]
In the first images of Titan's surface taken by Earth-based telescopes in the early 2000s, large regions of dark terrain were revealed straddling Titan's equator.&lt;ref name=Roe&gt;H. G. Roe ''et al.'' (2004). &quot;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2004GeoRL..3117S03 A new 1.6-micron map of Titan's surface]&quot;. ''Geophys. Res. Lett.'' '''31''' (17): CiteID L17S03.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the arrival of Cassini, these regions were thought to be seas of organic matter like tar or seas of liquid hydrocarbons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Glitter of Distant Seas | author= R. Lorenz|journal= Science | year=2003 | volume= 302 | pages= 403 - 404 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/312/5774/702 |doi=10.1126/science.1090464 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, radar images captured by the ''Cassini'' spacecraft have instead revealed some of these regions to be extensive plains covered in longitudinal sand [[dune]]s. The sand dunes are believed to be formed by wind generated as a result of tidal forces from Saturn on Titan's atmosphere, which are 400 times stronger than the tidal forces of the [[Moon]] on Earth. The tidal winds cause dunes to build up in long parallel lines, with Titan's [[zonal]] winds aligning the dunes west-to-east. The dunes break this pattern around mountains, where the wind direction is shifted.

Widespread evidence has also recently been found to support the claim that lakes of hydrocarbons do in fact exist on Titan's North pole during the second of several planned ''Cassini'' spacecraft flybys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/ap_060725_titan_lakes.html| title=Evidence of Hydrocarbon Lakes on Titan| first= Alicia| last=Chang| publisher=Associated Press| date=25 July 2006| accessdate=2006-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sand on Titan might have formed when liquid methane rained and eroded the ice bedrock, possibly in the form of flash floods. Alternatively, the sand could also have come from organic solids produced by photochemical reactions in Titan's atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Linear Dunes on Titan | author= N. Lancaster |journal= Science | year=2006 | volume= 312 | pages= 702 - 703 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/312/5774/702 |doi=10.1126/science.1126292 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Saharan Sand Dunes Found on Saturn's Moon Titan| url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/060504_sands_titan.html| first= Sara| last=Goudarzi| publisher=[[space.com]]|date=04 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The sand seas of Titan: Cassini RADAR observations of longitudinal dunes | author= Lorenz RD, Wall S, Radebaugh J, Boubin G, Reffet E, Janssen M, Stofan E, Lopes R, Kirk R, Elachi C, Lunine J, Mitchell K, Paganelli F, Soderblom L, Wood C, Wye L, Zebker H, Anderson Y, Ostro S, Allison M, Boehmer R, Callahan P, Encrenaz P, Ori GG, Francescetti G, Gim Y, Hamilton G, Hensley S, Johnson W, Kelleher K, Muhleman D, Picardi G, Posa F, Roth L, Seu R, Shaffer S, Stiles B, Vetrella S, Flamini E, West R |journal= Science | year=2006 | volume= 312 | pages= 724-727 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/312/5774/702 |doi=10.1126/science.1123257 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Huygens landing site====
{{main|Huygens probe}}
[[Image:Huygens surface color.jpg|thumb|right|''Huygens'' image from Titan's surface]]
The ''[[Huygens probe|Huygens]]'' probe landed just off the easternmost tip of a bright region now called [[Adiri (Titan)|Adiri]], and photographed pale hills with dark 'rivers' running down to a dark plain. Current understanding is that the hills (also referred to as highlands) are composed mainly of water ice. Dark organic compounds, created in the upper atmosphere by the ultraviolet radiation of the Sun, may rain from Titan's atmosphere. They are washed down the hills with the [[methane]] rain and are deposited on the plains over geological time scales.&lt;ref name=&quot;SEMHB881Y3E_0.html&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Cassini-Huygens/SEMHB881Y3E_0.html| title=Seeing, touching and smelling the extraordinarily Earth-like world of Titan| publisher=ESA News, [[European Space Agency]]| date=2005-01-21| accessdate=2005-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Huygens'' landed on a dark plain covered in small rocks and pebbles, which are composed of water ice.&lt;ref name=&quot;SEMHB881Y3E_0.html&quot;/&gt; The two rocks just below the middle of the image on the right are smaller than they may appear. The left-hand one is 15&amp;nbsp;centimeters (6&amp;nbsp;inches) across, and the one in the center is 4&amp;nbsp;centimeters (about 1.5&amp;nbsp;inches) across, at a distance of about 85&amp;nbsp;centimeters (about 33&amp;nbsp;inches) from ''Huygens''. There is evidence of erosion at the base of the rocks, indicating possible [[fluvial]] activity.
The surface is darker than originally expected, consisting of a mixture of water and hydrocarbon ice. It is believed that the 'soil' visible in the images is precipitation from the [[hydrocarbon]] haze above.

In march of 2007, [[NASA]], [[ESA]], and [[COSPAR]] decided to name the Huygens landing site as ''Hubert Curiel Memorial Station'' in memory of a president of the European Space Agency [http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEM9GNN0LYE_index_0.html]

==Exploration of Titan==
[[Image:Epimetheus Titan Saturn Rings Cassini Photo.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cassini-Huygens|''Cassini'']] image of [[Epimetheus (moon)|Epimetheus]] and Titan]]
Titan was examined by both ''[[Voyager 1]]'' and ''[[Voyager 2]]'', with ''Voyager 1''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s course being diverted specifically to make a closer pass of Titan. Unfortunately ''[[Voyager 1]]'' did not possess any instruments that could penetrate Titan's haze, an unforeseen factor. Many years later, intensive digital processing of images taken through ''Voyager 1'''s orange filter did reveal hints of the light and dark features now known as [[Xanadu (Titan)|Xanadu]] and [[the Sickle]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/~jrich/vgertitan.html Titan's Surface and Rotation: New Results from Voyager 1 Images] James Richardson, Ralph Lorenz, &amp; Alfred McEwen, Icarus, July 2004, Vol. 170/1, pp. 113-124 verified [[2005-03-28]].&lt;/ref&gt; but by then they had already been observed in the infrared by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]. ''Voyager 2'' took only a cursory look at Titan. The ''Voyager 2'' team had the option of steering the spacecraft to take a detailed look at Titan or to use another trajectory which would allow it to visit Uranus and Neptune. Given the lack of surface features seen by ''Voyager 1'', the latter plan was implemented.
The ''[[Cassini-Huygens]]'' spacecraft reached Saturn on [[July 1]], [[2004]] and has begun the process of mapping Titan's surface by [[radar]];
The ''Cassini'' probe flew by Titan on [[October 26]] [[2004]]&lt;ref name=&quot;huygens_picture_saturn&quot;&gt;[http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/operations/index.cfm NASA Page: Cassini-Huygens: Operations] ''&quot;Oct. 26, 2004: Cassini makes its first close pass by Titan. Cruising by at a distance of only 1,200&amp;nbsp;kilometers (750&amp;nbsp;miles), the spacecrafts radar provides the first detailed glimpses of the moon's mysterious surface.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and took the highest-resolution images ever of the moon's surface, at only 1,200&amp;nbsp;[[kilometer]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;huygens_picture_saturn&quot; /&gt; discerning patches of light and dark that would be invisible to the human eye from the Earth. ''[[Huygens probe|Huygens]]'' landed on Titan on [[January 14]], [[2005]],&lt;ref&gt;ibid. ''&quot;Jan. 14, 2005: The European Space Agency's Huygens probe descends through Titan's cloudy atmosphere, touching down on the surface about two and half hours later.&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; discovering that many of the moon's surface features seem to have been formed by flowing fluids at some point in the past. Present liquid on the surface may be found near the north pole, in the form of many lakes that were recently discovered by Cassini.&lt;ref name=&quot;PIA08630&quot;/&gt;

==Life on Titan==
Scientists believe that the atmosphere of early Earth was similar in composition to the current atmosphere on Titan. Many hypotheses have developed that attempt to bridge the step from chemical to biological evolution.
The [[Miller-Urey experiment]] and several following experiments have shown that with an atmosphere similar to that of Titan and the addition of [[UV radiation]], complex molecules and polymer substances like [[tholin]]s can be generated. The reaction starts with [[dissociation]] of nitrogen and methane forming [[Hydrogen Cyanide|hydrocyan]] and [[ethyne]]. Further reactions have been studied extensively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
| journal = Space Science Review
| volume= 104
| issue = 1-2

| doi = 10.1023/A:1023636623006
| title = Organic chemistry and exobiology on Titan
| author = Raulin F., Owen T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of these experiments have led to the suggestion that enough organic material exists on Titan to start a chemical evolution analogous to what is thought to have started life on Earth.  While the analogy assumes the presence of liquid water for longer periods than is currently observable, several theories suggest that liquid water from an impact could be preserved under a frozen isolation layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Artemivia N., Lunine J, | title = Createring on Titan: Impact melt ejecta and the fate of surface organics | year = 2003 | journal = Icarus | volume = 164| pages = 471-480|doi=10.1016/S0019-1035(03)00148-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that liquid ammonia oceans could exist deep below the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Grasset, O., Sotin C., Deschamps F., | title = On the internal structure and dynamic of Titan|year = 2000 | journal = Planetary and Space Science | volume = 48| pages = 617-636|doi=10.1016/S0032-0633(00)00039-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, Titan's distance from the [[Sun]] and the [[anti-greenhouse effect]] of its cloud cover, as well as the absence of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, would further limit the option for a fully analogous environment. With these many obstacles, the topic of life on Titan may best be described as a thought experiment for examining theories for life's origin on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.astrobio.net/news/article1130.html| title=Saturn's Moon Titan: Prebiotic Laboratory | publisher=astrobio.net| accessdate=2004-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, if life were able to develop on Titan, it would provide a mirror for examining the evolution of life on Earth. This line of reasoning has been challenged, however, by an alternate explanation for life's hypothetical existence on Titan.   It has been proposed that, if life were to be found on Titan, that it would be statistically more likely to have originated from Earth than to have appeared independently.  Research conducted by [[Brett Gladman]] of the [[University of British Columbia]] theorizes that large asteroid and cometary impacts on Earth's surface have caused hundreds of millions of fragments of microbe-laden rock to escape Earth's gravity. Further calculations indicate that a number of these would encounter many of the bodies in the solar system, including Titan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:GzD_sooHEL4J:news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4819370.stm+life+on+titan+moon&amp;hl=en&amp;strip=1

While the [[Cassini-Huygens]] mission was not equipped to provide evidence for biology or complex organics, it did support the existence of an environment on Titan that is similar, in some ways, to  that of the primordial Earth. However, at this time future missions and experiments are not currently being planned to research the question. Considering the time required for executing such a voyage, further scientific data would be decades away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Since Titan has a substantial atmosphere and is the most Earth-like satellite in the solar system, it has become one of the most popular extraterrestrial settings in science fiction other than Earth's [[Moon]] and the [[planet]]s. It has featured in and provided the backdrop for many stories in literature, film and television, and, in more recent times, computer games.

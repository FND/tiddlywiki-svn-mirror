The '''Solar System''' or '''solar system'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Capitalization]] of the name varies.  The [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]], the authoritative body regarding astronomical nomenclature, specifies [http://www.iau.org/SPELLING_OF_NAMES.240.0.html capitalizing the names of all individual astronomical objects] ('''Solar System'''). However, the name is commonly rendered in lower case ('''solar system''') including in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', [http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/solar%20system ''Merriam-Webster's 11th Collegiate Dictionary''], and [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110143 ''Encyclopædia Britannica''].&lt;/ref&gt; comprises the [[Sun]] and the retinue of [[astronomical object|celestial objects]] [[gravity|gravitationally]] bound to it: the eight [[planet]]s, their 162 known [[natural satellite|moon]]s,&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| title= The Jupiter Satellite Page|author=Scott S. Sheppardi|work=University of Hawaii|url=http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~sheppard/satellites/|accessdate=2006-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; three currently identified [[dwarf planet]]s and their four known moons, and thousands of [[small solar system body|small bodies]]. This last category includes [[asteroid]]s, [[meteoroid]]s, [[comets]], and [[interplanetary dust cloud|interplanetary dust]].

In broad terms, the charted regions of the Solar System consist of the Sun, four rocky bodies close to it called the [[terrestrial planets]], an inner belt of rocky [[asteroid]]s, four [[gas giant]] planets and an outer belt of small icy bodies known as the [[Kuiper belt]]. In order of their distances from the Sun, the planets are [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] ([[Image:Mercury symbol.svg|14px|{{unicode|☿}}]]), [[Venus]] ([[Image:Venus symbol.svg|14px|unicode|♀}}]]), [[Earth]] ([[Image:Earth symbol.svg|14px|{{unicode|⊕}}]]), [[Mars]] ([[Image:Mars symbol.svg|14px|{{unicode|♂}}]]), [[Jupiter]] ([[Image:Jupiter symbol.svg|14px|{{unicode|♃}}]]), [[Saturn]] ([[Image:Saturn symbol.svg|14px|{{unicode|♄}}]]), [[Uranus]] ([[Image:Uranus symbol.svg|14px|{{unicode|♅}}]]), and [[Neptune]] ([[Image:Neptune symbol.svg|14px|{{unicode|♆}}]]). Six of the eight planets are in turn orbited by [[natural satellite]]s (usually termed &quot;moons&quot; after Earth's [[Moon]]) and every planet past the [[asteroid belt]] is encircled by [[planetary ring]]s of dust and other particles. The planets other than Earth are named after gods and goddesses from [[Greek mythology|Greco]]-[[Roman mythology|Roman]] [[mythology]].

From 1930 to 2006, [[Pluto]] ([[Image:Pluto symbol.svg|14px|{{unicode|♇}}]]), the largest known [[Kuiper belt]] object, was considered the Solar System's ninth planet. However, in  2006 the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) created an official [[2006 redefinition of planet|definition of the term &quot;planet&quot;]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iau2006.org/mirror/www.iau.org/iau0603/index.html IAU Resolutions, including 5a - Definition of a planet]&lt;/ref&gt; Under this definition, Pluto is reclassified as a [[dwarf planet]], and there are eight planets in the Solar System. In addition to Pluto, the IAU currently recognizes two other [[dwarf planet]]s: [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] ([[Image:Ceres symbol.svg|14px|Old symbol of Ceres]]), the largest object in the asteroid belt, and [[136199 Eris|Eris]], which lies beyond the Kuiper belt in a region called the [[scattered disc]]. Of the known dwarf planets, only Ceres has no moons.

==Layout and structure==
The principal component of the Solar System is the [[Sun]] or [[Sol]] ([[astronomical symbol]]
[[Image:Sun symbol.svg|14px|{{unicode|☉}}]]); a [[main sequence]] [[stellar classification|G2]] [[star]] that contains 99.86% of the system's known [[mass]] and dominates it gravitationally.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | author= M Woolfson| title=The origin and evolution of the solar system| work=University of York| url=http://www.oso.chalmers.se/~michael/astrobiologi-2003/j.1468-4004.2000.00012.x.pdf
| accessdate=2006-07-22}} &lt;/ref&gt; [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] are the Sun's two largest [[orbit]]ing bodies and account for more than 90% of the system's remaining mass. (The currently hypothetical [[Oort cloud]] would also hold a substantial percentage were its existence confirmed).&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| title=Estimates of mass and angular momentum in the Oort cloud|author=Marochnik, Leonid S.; Mukhin, Lev M.; Sagdeev, Roal'd.

[[Image:solarsystem.jpg|thumb|200 px|The ecliptic viewed in sunlight from behind the Moon in this [[Clementine mission|Clementine]] image. From left to right: Mercury, Mars, Saturn]]
Most objects in orbit around the Sun lie within the [[ecliptic]], a shallow plane which is roughly parallel to the Sun's equator. The planets are very close to the ecliptic while [[comets]] and [[kuiper belt objects]] are usually at significantly greater angles to it. 

All of the planets (and most other objects) also orbit with the Sun's rotation; in a counter-clockwise direction as viewed from a point above the Sun's north pole. There is a direct relationship between how far away a planet is from the Sun and how quickly it orbits. Mercury, the closest to the Sun, travels the fastest, while Neptune, being much farther from the Sun, travels more slowly. Objects orbit in an [[ellipse]] around the Sun, so an orbiting object's distance from the Sun varies in the course of its year. Its closest approach to the Sun is known as its [[perihelion]] while its farthest point from the Sun is called its [[aphelion]]. Although the orbits of the planets are nearly circular (with perihelions roughly equal to their aphelions), many comets, asteroids and objects of the Kuiper belt follow highly elliptical orbits with large differences between perihelion and aphelion. The paths of objects around the Sun travel according to a law of planetary motion discovered by German astronomer [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Johannes Kepler]] in the early 1600s. The sun is slightly off to the side of the center of each ellipse at a point called a focus. The focus is actually a point just outside the centre of the Sun called the barycenter of the solar system.

Astronomers most often measure distances within the solar system in [[astronomical unit]]s or AU. One AU is the average distance between the Earth and the Sun or roughly 149 598 000&amp;nbsp;km (93,000,000 mi). [[Pluto]] is roughly 39&amp;nbsp;AU from the Sun while [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]] lies at roughly 5.2&amp;nbsp;AU.

Informally, the Solar System is sometimes divided into separate zones. The first zone, known as the '''inner Solar System''', includes the four [[terrestrial planet]]s and the main asteroid belt. The '''[[outer Solar System]]''' is sometimes defined as &quot;everything beyond the asteroids&quot;. Alternatively, the term may be used to describe the region beyond Neptune, with the four [[gas giant]]s considered a separate &quot;middle zone&quot;.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| title= New Horizons Set to Launch on 9-Year Voyage to Pluto and the Kuiper Belt|author=Amir Alexander

[[Image:Oort_cloud_Sedna_orbit.jpg|thumb|200 px|The orbits of the bodies in the solar system to scale (clockwise from top left)]]
One common misconception is that the orbits of the major objects within the Solar System (planets, Pluto and asteroids) are equidistant. To cope with the vast distances involved, many representations of the Solar System simplify these orbits by showing them the same distance apart. However, in reality, with a few exceptions, the Solar System is arranged so that the farther a planet or belt is from the Sun, the larger the distance between it and the previous orbit. For example, [[Venus]] is approximately 0.33 AU farther out than [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] while [[Jupiter]] is 1.9 AU from the farthest extent of the [[asteroid belt]] and Neptune's orbit is roughly 20 AU farther out than that of Uranus. Attempts have been made to determine a correlation between these distances (see [[Bode's Law]]) but to date there is no accepted theory that explains the orbital distances.

{{Main|Planet|Dwarf planet|Small solar system body}}
{{Further|[[2006 redefinition of planet]]}}
In a decision passed by the  [[International Astronomical Union]] General Assembly on August 24, 2006, the objects in the Solar System other than the Sun and [[natural satellite]]s were divided into three separate groups: ''planets'', ''dwarf planets'' and ''small solar system bodies''. 

Under this classification, a '''[[planet]]''' is any body in orbit around the Sun that a) has enough mass to form itself into a spherical shape and b) has cleared its immediate neighborhood of all smaller objects. Eight objects in the Solar System currently meet this definition; they are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. 

'''[[Dwarf planet]]''' was a second and new classification. The key difference between planets and dwarf planets is that while both are required to orbit the Sun and be of large enough mass that their own gravity pulls them into a nearly round shape, dwarf planets are not required to [[Clearing the neighborhood|clear their neighborhood]] of other celestial bodies. Three objects in the solar system are currently included in this category; they are [[Pluto]] (formerly considered a planet), the asteroid [[1 Ceres|Ceres]], and the [[scattered disc]] object [[136199 Eris|Eris]]. The IAU will begin evaluating other known objects to see if they fit within the definition of dwarf planets.  The most likely candidates are some of the larger asteroids and several Trans-Neptunian Objects such as [[90377 Sedna|Sedna]], [[90482 Orcus|Orcus]], and [[50000 Quaoar|Quaoar]].

The remainder of the objects in the Solar System were classified as '''[[small solar system bodies]]''' ('''SSSBs'''). As the IAU noted in its resolution: 
:''These currently include most of the Solar System asteroids, most Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs), comets, and other small bodies.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iau2006.org/mirror/www.iau.org/iau0602/index.html Definitions as voted on]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==

{{main|Formation and evolution of the solar system|Solar nebula}}

The current hypothesis of Solar System formation is the [[nebular hypothesis]], first proposed in 1755 by [[Immanuel Kant]] and independently formulated by [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |year=1909| title= The Past History of the Earth as Inferred from the Mode of Formation of the Solar System|work= American Philosophical Society|url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0003-049X%28190901%2F04%2948%3A191%3C119%3ATPHOTE%3E2.0.CO%3B2-U&amp;size=LARGE|accessdate=2006-07-23}} &lt;/ref&gt; The nebular theory holds that 4.6 billion years ago (a date determined via [[radiometric dating]] of [[meteorite]]s),&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|year= 1982|author=Joel Cracraft|title= The Scientific Response to Creationism| work=Department of Astronomy, University of Illinois|url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0162-2439(198222)7%3A40%3C79%3ATSRTC%3E2.0.CO%3B2-B
|accessdate=2006-07-23}} &lt;/ref&gt; the Solar System formed from the gravitational collapse of a gaseous cloud called the [[solar nebula]]. It had a diameter of 100&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical Unit|AU]] and was 2–3 times the mass of the Sun. {{cn}} Over time, a disturbance (possibly a nearby [[supernova]]) &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|year= 2004|author=Alan P.

|accessdate=2006-11-19}} &lt;/ref&gt; squeezed the nebula, pushing matter inward until gravitational forces overcame the internal gas pressure and it began to collapse. As the nebula collapsed, conservation of [[angular momentum]] meant that it spun faster, and became warmer. As the competing forces associated with gravity, gas pressure, magnetic fields, and rotation acted on it, the contracting nebula began to flatten into a spinning [[protoplanetary disk]] with a gradually contracting [[protostar]] at the center.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|year= 2005|author=Jane S.

|accessdate=2006-11-16}} &lt;/ref&gt; Studies of young, pre-fusing solar mass stars, called [[T Tauri star]]s, show that these discs extend to several hundred&amp;nbsp;AU and are rather cool, reaching only a thousand kelvins at their hottest.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|year= 2003|author=Manfred Küker, Thomas Henning and Günther Rüdiger|title= Magnetic Star-Disk Coupling in Classical T Tauri Systems| work=Science Magazine|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/ApJ/journal/issues/ApJ/v589n1/56674/56674.text.html
|accessdate=2006-11-16}} &lt;/ref&gt; 

From this cloud and its gas and dust, the various planets formed. The currently accepted method by which the planets formed is known as [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]], in which the planets began as dust grains in orbit around the central protostar, which initially formed by direct contact into clumps between one and ten kilometres in diameter, which in turn collided to form larger bodies ([[planetesimals]]), of roughly 5 km in size gradually increasing by further collisions by roughly 15 cm per year over the course of the next few million years.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|year=1973|author=Peter Goldreich and William R.

|accessdate=2006-11-16}} &lt;/ref&gt; 

The inner solar system was too warm for volatile molecules like water and methane to condense, and so the planetesimals which formed there were relatively small (comprising only 0.6% the mass of the disc) {{cn}} and composed largely of compounds with high melting points, such as [[silicate]]s and [[metal]]s. These rocky bodies eventually became the [[terrestrial planets]]. Farther out, the gravitational effects of [[Jupiter]] made it impossible for the protoplanetary objects present to come together, leaving behind the [[asteroid belt]]. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|year= 2001|author=Jean-Marc Petit and Alessandro Morbidelli|title=The Primordial Excitation and Clearing of the Asteroid Belt| work=Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Observatoire de Nice,|url=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/classes/ge133/reading/asteroids.pdf
|accessdate=2006-11-19}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Farther out still, beyond the [[frost line (astrophysics)|frost line]], where more volatile icy compounds could remain solid, [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] were able to gather more material than the terrestrial planets, as those compounds were more common. They became the [[gas giants]], while [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]] captured much less material and are known as ice giants because their cores are believed to be made mostly of ices (hydrogen compounds).&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|year=2003|author=M.

==Sun==
{{main|Sun}}
[[Image:The sun1.jpg|thumb|200px|The Sun as seen from Earth.]]
The [[Sun]] is the Solar System's parent star, and far and away its chief component. Its large mass gives it an interior [[density]] high enough to sustain [[nuclear fusion]], releasing enormous amounts of [[energy]], most of which is [[Radiant energy|radiated]] into space in the form of [[electromagnetic radiation]] including visible [[light]]. It is classed as a moderately large [[yellow dwarf]]; however, this name is misleading, as on the scale of stars in our galaxy, the Sun is rather large and bright. Stars are classified based on their position on the [[Hertzsprung-Russell diagram]], a graph which plots the brightness of stars against their surface temperatures. Generally speaking, the hotter a star is, the brighter it is. Stars which follow this pattern are said to be on the [[main sequence]], and the Sun lies right in the middle of it. This has led many astronomy textbooks to label the Sun as &quot;average;&quot; however, stars brighter and hotter than it are rare, whereas stars dimmer and cooler than it are common. The vast majority of stars are dim [[red dwarfs]], though they are under-represented in star catalogues as we can observe only those few that are very near the Sun in space.
[[Image:HRDiagram.gif|thumb|200px|The [[Hertzsprung-Russell diagram]]. The main sequence is from bottom right to top left]]
The Sun's position on the [[main sequence]] means, according to current theories of stellar evolution, that it is in the &quot;prime of life&quot; for a star, in that it has not yet exhausted its store of hydrogen for [[nuclear fusion]], and been forced, as older [[red giants]] must, to fuse more inefficient elements such as [[helium]] and [[carbon]]. The Sun is growing increasingly bright as it ages. Early in its history, it was roughly 75 percent as bright as it is today.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kasting&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| last=Kasting| first=J.F.| coauthors=Ackerman, T.P.| year=1986| title=Climatic Consequences of Very High Carbon Dioxide Levels in the Earth’s Early Atmosphere| journal=Science| volume=234| pages=1383-1385}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calculations of the ratios of hydrogen and helium within the Sun suggest it is roughly halfway through its life cycle, and will eventually begin moving off the main sequence, becoming larger and brighter but also cooler and redder, until, about five billion years from now, it too will become a red giant.

The Sun is a [[population I]] star, meaning that it is fairly new in galactic terms, having been born in the later stages of the universe's evolution. As such, it contains more elements heavier than hydrogen and helium (&quot;'''metals'''&quot; in astronomical parlance) than older [[population II]] stars such as those found in [[globular clusters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=T. S. van Albada, Norman Baker | title=On the Two Oosterhoff Groups of Globular Clusters | journal=Astrophysical Journal | volume=185 | year=1973 | pages=477–498 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since elements heavier than hydrogen and helium were formed in the cores of ancient and exploding stars, the first generation of stars had to die before the universe could be enriched with them. For this reason, the very oldest stars contain very few metals, while stars born later have more. This high [[metallicity]] is thought to have been crucial in the Sun's developing a [[planetary system]], because planets form from accretion of metals.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| title=An Estimate of the Age Distribution of Terrestrial Planets in the Universe: Quantifying Metallicity as a Selection Effect|author=Charles H.

==Interplanetary medium==
{{main|Interplanetary medium}}
[[Image:Heliospheric-current-sheet.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[heliospheric current sheet]]]]
The Sun radiates a continuous stream of charged particles, a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] known as [[solar wind]], ejecting it outwards at speeds greater than 2 million kilometres per hour,&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| title=Solar Physics: The Solar Wind||work=Marshall Space Flight Center|date=2006|url=http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/SolarWind.shtml| accessdate=2006-10-03}} &lt;/ref&gt; creating a very tenuous atmosphere (the [[heliosphere]]), that permeates the solar system for at least 100&amp;nbsp;AU. This environment is known as the [[interplanetary medium]].  The influence of the Sun's rotating magnetic field on the interplanetary medium creates the largest structure in the solar system, the [[heliospheric current sheet]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| title=Artist's Conception of the Heliospheric Current Sheet| work=Wilcox Solar Observatory | url=http://quake.stanford.edu/~wso/gifs/HCS.html| accessdate=2006-06-22}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Earth's [[magnetic field]] protects its atmosphere from interacting with the solar wind. However, Venus and Mars do not have magnetic fields, and the solar wind causes their atmospheres to gradually bleed away into space.

The interplanetary medium is home to at least two disclike regions of [[cosmic dust]]. The first, which lies in the inner solar system, is known as the [[zodiacal dust cloud]] and is responsible for the phenomenon of [[zodiacal light]]. It was likely formed by collisions within the asteroid belt brought on by interactions with the planets.&lt;ref&gt; [http://astrobiology.arc.nasa.gov/workshops/1997/zodiac/backman/IIIc.html  Long-term Evolution of the Zodiacal Cloud] &lt;/ref&gt; The second, which extends from about 10 AU to about 40 AU, was probaby created by similar collisions within the Kuiper belt.&lt;ref&gt; [http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=29471

==Inner planets==
{{main|Terrestrial planet}}
[[Image:Terrestrial planet size comparisons.jpg|thumb|300 px|The inner planets. From left to right: [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Earth]], and [[Mars]] (sizes to scale)]]
The four '''inner''' or [[terrestrial planet]]s are characterised by their dense, [[rock (geology)|rocky]] composition, few or no moons, and lack of ring systems. They are composed largely of minerals with high melting points, such as the [[silicates]] which form their solid [[crust (geology)|crusts]] and semi-liquid [[mantle (geology)|mantle]]s, and metals such as [[iron]] and [[nickel]], which form their [[planetary core|cores]]. Three of the four inner planets (Venus, Earth and Mars) have substantial atmospheres; all have [[impact crater]]s and possess tectonic surface features such as [[rift valley]]s and [[volcanoes]]. The term ''inner planet'' should not be confused with '''[[inferior planet]]''', which designates those planets which are closer to the Sun than the Earth is (i.e. Mercury and Venus).

The four inner planets are:

===Mercury===
'''[[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]''' (0.4&amp;nbsp;AU), the closest planet to the Sun, is also the least massive of the planets, at only 0.055 Earth masses. Mercury is very different from the other terrestrial planets; it has no [[natural satellite]], and its only known geological features besides [[impact crater]]s are &quot;wrinkle ridges&quot; probably produced by a period of contraction early in its history. Its almost negligible atmosphere consists of atoms blasted off its surface by the solar wind.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |year= 2006| author= Bill Arnett| title=Mercury| work=The Nine Planets| url=http://www.nineplanets.org/mercury.html
| accessdate=2006-09-14}} &lt;/ref&gt; Its relatively large iron core and thin mantle have not yet been adequately explained. Hypotheses include that its outer layers were stripped off by a giant impact, and that it was prevented from fully accreting by the Sun's gravity.

===Venus===
'''[[Venus]]''' (0.7&amp;nbsp;AU) is of comparable mass to the [[Earth (planet)|Earth]] (0.815 Earth masses), and, like Earth, possesses a thick silicate mantle around an iron core, as well as a substantial [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]] and evidence of internal geological activity, such as [[volcanoes]]. However, it is much drier than Earth and its atmosphere is 90 times as dense. Venus has no natural satellite. It is the hottest planet, with surface temperatures over 400 °C, most likely due to the amount of [[greenhouse gases]] in the atmosphere. Although no definitive evidence of current geological activity has yet been detected on Venus, its substantial atmosphere and lack of a magnetic field to protect it from depletion by the solar wind suggest that it must be regularly replenished by volcanic eruptions. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |year= 1999| author= Paul Rincon| title=Climate Change as a Regulator

| accessdate=2006-19-11}} &lt;/ref&gt;

===Earth===
The largest and densest of the inner planets, '''[[Earth]]''' (1&amp;nbsp;AU) is also the only one to demonstrate unequivocal evidence of current geological activity. Earth is the only planet known to have life. Its liquid [[hydrosphere]], unique among the terrestrial planets, is probably the reason Earth is also the only planet where [[plate tectonics]] has been observed, because water acts as a lubricant for [[subduction]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|title=Shear stresses on megathrusts: Implications for mountain building behind subduction zones| work=Department of Earth Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK|url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2006/2005JB003916.shtml| accessdate=2006-07-23}} &lt;/ref&gt; Its atmosphere is radically different from the other terrestrial planets, having been altered by the presence of life to contain 21 percent free oxygen. It has one satellite, the [[Moon]]; the only large satellite of a terrestrial planet in the Solar System.

===Mars===
'''[[Mars]]''' (1.5&amp;nbsp;AU), at only 0.107 Earth masses, is less massive than either Earth or Venus. It possesses a tenuous atmosphere of carbon dioxide. Its surface, peppered with vast volcanoes and rift valleys such as [[Valles Marineris]], shows that it was once geologically active and recent evidence&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |year= 2004| title= Modern Martian Marvels: Volcanoes?|author=David Noever |work=NASA Astrobiology Magazine|url=http://www.astrobio.net/news/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1360&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0| accessdate=2006-07-23}} &lt;/ref&gt; suggests this may have been true until very recently. Mars possesses two tiny [[natural satellite|moon]]s ([[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]] and [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]]) thought to be captured [[asteroid]]s.

==Asteroid belt==
{{main|Asteroid belt}}
[[Image:InnerSolarSystem-en.png|300px|thumb|Image of the main asteroid belt and the Trojan asteroids.]]
'''[[Asteroid]]s''' are mostly [[small solar system bodies]] that are composed in significant part of rocky and metallic non-volatile minerals.

The main '''[[asteroid belt]]''' occupies the orbit between Mars and Jupiter, between 2.3 and 3.3&amp;nbsp;AU from the Sun. It is thought to be the remnants from the Solar System's formation that failed to coalesce because of the gravitational interference of Jupiter. Asteroids range in size from hundreds of kilometers to as small as dust. All asteroids save the largest, [[1 Ceres|Ceres]], are classified as [[small solar system bodies]]; however, a number of other asteroids, such as [[4 Vesta|Vesta]] and [[10 Hygeia|Hygeia]], could potentially be reclassed as [[dwarf planets]] if it can be conclusively shown that they have achieved [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]. The asteroid belt contains tens of thousands - and potentially millions - of objects over one kilometre in diameter.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |year= 2002| title= New study reveals twice as many asteroids as previously believed| work=ESA| url=http://www.alphagalileo.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=readRelease&amp;Releaseid=9162| accessdate=2006-06-23}} &lt;/ref&gt; However, despite their large numbers, the total mass of the main belt is unlikely to be more than a thousandth of that of the [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|title= Hidden Mass in the Asteroid Belt|author= Krasinsky G.A., Pitjeva E.V., Vasilyev M.V., Yagudina E.I.|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/search/expand?pub=infobike://ap/is/2002/00000158/00000001/art06837&amp;unc=| accessdate=2006-06-23}} &lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to its various depictions in [[science fiction]], the main belt is very sparsely populated; spacecraft routinely pass through without incident. Asteroids with a diameter of less than 50 m are called [[meteoroids]].

===Ceres===
[[Image:Ceres_Hubble_sing.jpg|left|thumb|120px|Ceres]]
'''[[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]]''' (2.77&amp;nbsp;AU) is the largest astronomical body in the asteroid belt and the only known [[dwarf planet]] in this region. It has a diameter of slightly under 1000 km, large enough for its own gravity to pull it into a spherical shape. Ceres was considered a planet when it was discovered in the nineteenth century, but was reclassified as an asteroid as further observation revealed additional asteroids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= History and Discovery of Asteroids | author=NASA |  work=NASA | url=http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/DawnClassrooms/1_hist_dawn/history_discovery/Development/a_modeling_scale.doc | accessdate=2006-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since been again reclassified as a dwarf planet.

===Asteroid groups===
Asteroids in the main belt are subdivided into [[asteroid group]]s and [[:Category:Asteroid groups and families|families]] based on their specific orbital characteristics. [[Asteroid moon]]s are asteroids that orbit larger asteroids. They are not as clearly distinguished as planetary moons, sometimes being almost as large as their partners. The asteroid belt also contains [[main-belt comets]]&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |year= 2006| author= Phil Berardelli | title= Main-Belt Comets May Have Been Source Of Earths Water| work=SpaceDaily | url=http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Main_Belt_Comets_May_Have_Been_Source_Of_Earths_Water.html| accessdate=2006-06-23}} &lt;/ref&gt; which may have been the source of Earth's water.

[[Trojan asteroid]]s are located in either of Jupiter's [[Lagrange point|L&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or L&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; points]], (gravitationally stable regions leading and trailing a planet in its orbit) though the term is also sometimes used for asteroids in any other planetary Lagrange point as well. [[Hilda family|Hilda asteroid]]s are those Trojans whose orbits are in a 2:3 resonance with Jupiter; that is, they go around the Sun three times for every two Jupiter orbits. 

The inner solar system is also dusted with rogue asteroids, many of which cross the orbits of the inner planets.

==Outer planets==
{{main|Gas giant}}
[[Image:Gas giants in the solar system.jpg|thumb|200 px|From top to bottom: [[Neptune]], [[Uranus]], [[Saturn]], and [[Jupiter]] (sizes not to scale).]]
The four '''outer planets''', or [[gas giant]]s, (sometimes called [[Jovian planet]]s) are so large they collectively make up 99 percent of the mass known to orbit the Sun. [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] are true giants, at 318 and 95 Earth masses, respectively, and composed largely of hydrogen and helium. [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]] are both substantially smaller, being only 14 and 17 Earth masses, respectively. Their atmospheres contain a smaller percentage of hydrogen and helium, and a higher percentage of “ices”, such as [[water]], [[ammonia]] and [[methane]]. For this reason some astronomers suggested that they belong in their own category, “Uranian planets,” or “ice giants.” All four of the gas giants exhibit orbital debris rings, although only the ring system of Saturn is easily observable from Earth. The term ''outer planet'' should not be confused with '''[[superior planet]]''', which designates those planets which lie outside [[Earth]]'s orbit (thus consisting of the outer planets plus [[Mars]]).

===Jupiter===
'''[[Jupiter]]''' (5.2&amp;nbsp;AU), at 318 Earth masses, is 2.5 times the mass of all the other planets put together. Its composition of largely [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] is not very different from that of the Sun.  Jupiter's strong internal heat creates a number of semi-permanent features in its atmosphere, such as cloud bands and the [[Great Red Spot]]. The four largest of its 63 [[natural satellite|satellites]], [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]], [[Io (moon)|Io]], and [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] (the [[Galilean satellites]]) share elements in common with the terrestrial planets, such as volcanism and internal heating. Ganymede, the largest satellite in the Solar System, has a diameter larger than [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]].

===Saturn===
'''[[Saturn]]''' (9.5&amp;nbsp;AU), famous for its extensive [[planetary ring|ring system]], has many qualities in common with Jupiter, including its atmospheric composition, though it is far less massive, being only 95 Earth masses. Two of its 56 moons, [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] and [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]], show signs of geological activity, though they are largely [[Cryovolcano|made of ice]]. Titan, like Ganymede, is larger than [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]; it is also the only satellite in the solar system with a substantial atmosphere.

===Uranus===
'''[[Uranus]]''' (19.6&amp;nbsp;AU) at 14 Earth masses, is the lightest of the outer planets. Uniquely among the planets, it orbits the Sun on its side; its [[axial tilt]] lies at over ninety degrees to the [[ecliptic]]. Its core is remarkably cold compared with the other gas giants, and radiates very little heat into space. Uranus has 27 satellites, the largest being [[Titania (moon)|Titania]], [[Oberon (moon)|Oberon]], [[Umbriel (moon)|Umbriel]], [[Ariel (moon)|Ariel]] and [[Miranda (moon)|Miranda]].

===Neptune===
'''[[Neptune]]''' (30&amp;nbsp;AU), though slightly smaller than Uranus, is denser and slightly more massive, at 17 Earth masses, and radiates more internal heat than Uranus, but not as much as Jupiter or Saturn. Neptune has 13 moons. The largest, [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], is geologically active, with geysers of [[liquid nitrogen]], and is the only large satellite to revolve around its host planet in a prograde (clockwise) motion. Neptune possesses a number of [[Neptune Trojan|Trojan asteroid]]s.

==Comets==
[[Image:Comet c1995o1.jpg|right|thumb|100 px|Comet Hale-Bopp]]
'''[[Comet]]s''' are [[small solar system bodies]] (usually only a few kilometres across) composed largely of volatile ices, which possess highly eccentric orbits, generally having a [[perihelion]] within the orbit of the inner planets and an [[aphelion]] far beyond Pluto. When a comet approaches the Sun, its icy surface begins to sublimate, or boil away, creating a [[coma (cometary)|coma]]; a long tail of gas and dust which is often visible with the naked eye.

There are two basic types of comet: short-period comets, with orbits less than 200 years, and long-period comets, with orbits lasting thousands of years. Short-period comets, such as [[Halley's Comet]], are believed to originate in the [[#Kuiper belt|Kuiper belt]], while long period comets, such as [[Hale-Bopp]] (pictured), are believed to originate in the [[Oort Cloud]]. Some comets with [[hyperbola|hyperbolic]] orbits may originate outside the solar system. Old comets that have had most of their volatiles driven out by solar warming are often categorized as asteroids.

==Kuiper belt==
[[Image:TheKuiperBelt Projections 55AU Classical Plutinos.svg|200 px|rihgt|thumb|Diagram showing the resonant and classical Kuiper belt]]
The area beyond Neptune, often referred to as the [[outer solar system]] or simply the &quot;[[trans-Neptunian objects|trans-Neptunian region]]&quot;, is still largely unexplored.

This region's first formation is the '''[[Kuiper belt]]''', a great ring of debris, similar to the asteroid belt but composed mainly of ice and far greater in extent, which lies between 30 and 50&amp;nbsp;AU from the Sun. This region is thought to be the place of origin for short-period [[comet]]s, such as [[Halley's comet]]. Though it is composed mainly of [[small solar system bodies]], many of the largest Kuiper belt objects, such as [[50000 Quaoar|Quaoar]], [[20000 Varuna|Varuna]], [[2003 EL61]], [[(136472) 2005 FY9|2005 FY9]] and [[90482 Orcus|Orcus]], could soon be reclassified as dwarf planets. There are estimated to be over 100,000 [[Kuiper belt object]]s with a diameter greater than 50&amp;nbsp;km; however, the total mass of the Kuiper belt is relatively low, perhaps barely equalling the mass of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |year= 2003|author= SCOTT J. KENYON, JANE X. LUU|title=ACCRETION IN THE EARLY KUIPER BELT. I.

The Kuiper belt can be roughly divided into two regions: the &quot;resonant&quot; belt, consisting of objects whose orbits are in some way linked to that of Neptune (orbiting, for instance, three times for every two Neptune orbits, or twice for every one), which actually begins within the orbit of Neptune itself, and the &quot;classical&quot; belt, consisting of objects that don't have any resonance with Neptune, and which extends from roughly 39.4&amp;nbsp;AU to 47.7&amp;nbsp;AU.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |year=2005|author= M. W. Buie, R. L. Millis, L. H. Wasserman, J. L. Elliot, S. D. Kern, K. B. Clancy, E. I. Chiang, A. B. Jordan, K. J. Meech, R. M. Wagner, D. E.

|accessdate=2006-09-07}} &lt;/ref&gt; Members of the classical Kuiper belt are classified as [[Cubewano]]s, after the first of their kind to be discovered, [[1992 QB1]].

===Pluto===
[[Image:Pluto_system_2006.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Pluto, and its three known moons]]
'''[[Pluto]]''' (39&amp;nbsp;AU average), is the largest known object in the [[Kuiper belt]] and was previously accepted as the smallest planet in the Solar System. In 2006, it was reclassified as a [[dwarf planet]] by the Astronomers Congress organized by the International Astronomers Union (IAU).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.iau2006.org/mirror/www.iau.org/iau0603/index.html|title=IAU 2006 General Assembly: Result of the IAU Resolution votes|accessdate=2006-09-02|date=2006-08-24|publisher=IAU}} &lt;/ref&gt; Pluto has a relatively eccentric orbit inclined 17 degrees to the ecliptic plane and ranging from 29.7&amp;nbsp;AU from the Sun at [[perihelion]] (within the orbit of Neptune) to 49.5&amp;nbsp;AU at [[aphelion]]. Prior to the [[2006 redefinition of planet|2006 redefinitions]], [[Charon (planet)|Charon]] was considered a moon of Pluto, but in light of the redefinition it is unclear whether Charon will continue to be classified as a moon of Pluto or as a dwarf planet itself.  Charon does not exactly orbit Pluto in a traditional sense; Charon is about one-tenth the mass of Pluto and  the center of gravity of the pair is not within Pluto.  Both bodies orbit a [[barycenter]] of gravity above the surface of Pluto (in empty space), making Pluto-Charon a [[binary system]]. Two much smaller moons, Nix and Hydra, orbit Pluto and Charon. Pluto lies in the resonant belt, having a 3:2 resonance with Neptune (ie, it orbits three times round the Sun for every two Neptune orbits). Those Kuiper belt objects which share this orbit with Pluto are called [[Plutino]]s.

==Scattered disc==
[[Image:TheKuiperBelt_Projections_100AU_Classical_SDO.svg|thumb|right|200px|Black: scattered disc; blue: classical Kuiper belt; green: resonant KBOs inc. Pluto.]]
Overlapping the Kuiper belt but extending much further outwards is the '''[[scattered disc]]'''. Scattered disc objects are believed to have been originally native to the Kuiper belt, but were ejected into erratic orbits in the outer fringes by the gravitational influence of Neptune's outward migration (''see [[Formation and evolution of the solar system#Outer planets|Formation and evolution of the Solar System]]''). Most scattered disc objects have perihelia within the Kuiper belt but aphelia as far as 150&amp;nbsp;AU from the Sun. Their orbits are also highly inclined to the ecliptic plane, and are often almost perpendicular to it. Some astronomers, such as Kuiper belt co-discoverer [[David Jewitt]], consider the scattered disc to be merely another region of the Kuiper belt, and describe scattered disc objects as &quot;scattered Kuiper belt objects.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |year= 2005| author= David Jewitt| title=The 1000 km Scale KBOs| work=University of Hawaii| url=http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/faculty/jewitt/kb/big_kbo.html| accessdate=2006-07-16}}  &lt;/ref&gt; 

'''[[Centaur (planetoid)|Centaur]]s''', which roughly extend from 9 to 30&amp;nbsp;AU, are icy comet-like bodies that orbit in the region between Jupiter and Neptune. The largest known Centaur, [[10199 Chariklo]], has a diameter of between 200 and 250&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/astro/tnodiam.html |title=TNO/Centaur diameters and albedos |accessdate=2006-11-08 |last=Stansberry |date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first centaur to be discovered, [[2060 Chiron]], has been called a comet since it has been shown to develop a coma just as comets do when they approach the sun.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |year= 1995| author=Patrick Vanouplines | title= Chiron biography| work=Vrije Universitiet Brussel| url=http://www.vub.ac.be/STER/www.astro/chibio.htm| accessdate=2006-06-23}} &lt;/ref&gt; Some asronomers class Centaurs as scattered Kuiper belt objects along with the residents of the scattered disc; merely Kuiper belt objects scattered inward, rather than outward.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/lists/Centaurs.html ''List Of Centaurs and Scattered-Disk Objects''] at the ''IAU: Minor Planet Center''&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Eris===
[[Image:Xenaandgabrielle.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Eris and its moon [[Dysnomia (moon)|Dysnomia]]]]
'''[[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]]''' (68&amp;nbsp;AU average) is the largest known [[#scattered disc|scattered disc object]] and was the cause of the most recent debate about [[Definition of planet|what constitutes a planet]] since it is at least 5% larger than Pluto with an estimated diameter of 2400&amp;nbsp;km (1500&amp;nbsp;mi).  It is now the largest of the known [[dwarf planet]]s.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |year= 2005| author= Mike Brown| title=The discovery of &lt;s&gt;2003 UB313&lt;/s&gt; Eris, the &lt;s&gt;10th planet&lt;/s&gt; largest known dwarf planet.| work=CalTech| url=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/planetlila/| accessdate=2006-09-15}} &lt;/ref&gt;  It has one moon, [[Dysnomia (moon)|Dysnomia]].

The object has many similarities with Pluto: its orbit is highly eccentric, with a [[perihelion]] of 38.2&amp;nbsp;AU (roughly Pluto's distance from the Sun) and an [[aphelion]] of 97.6&amp;nbsp;AU, and is steeply inclined to the ecliptic plane, at 44 degrees, more so than any known object in the solar system except the newly-discovered object {{mpl|2004 XR|190}} (also known as &quot;Buffy&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year= 2005| author= Francis Reddy| title=Tenth planet discovered | work=Astronomy Magazine| url=http://www.astronomy.com/asy/default.aspx?c=a&amp;id=3401| accessdate=2006-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and is believed to consist largely of rock and ice.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |year= 2005| author= Mike Brown | title=Dysnomia, the moon of Eris | work=CalTech| url=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/%7Embrown/planetlila/moon/index.html| accessdate=2006-09-15}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Farthest regions==
The point at which the solar system ends and interstellar space begins is not precisely defined, since its outer boundaries are delineated by two separate forces: the [[solar wind]] and the [[Sun]]'s [[gravity]]. The solar wind extends to a point roughly 130&amp;nbsp;AU from the Sun, whereupon it surrenders to the surrounding environment of the [[interstellar medium]]. The Sun's gravity however, holds sway to almost halfway to the next star system. The vast majority of the solar system therefore, is completely unknown; however, recent observations of both the solar system and other star systems have led to an increased understanding of what is or may be lying at its outer edge.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |year= 2006| author= Bill Arnett | title= The Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud| work=nineplanets.org| url=http://www.nineplanets.org/kboc.html| accessdate=2006-06-23}} &lt;/ref&gt;

===Heliopause===
[[Image:Voyager 1 entering heliosheath region.jpg|right|thumb|200 px|The Voyagers entering the heliosheath]]
The heliosphere expands outward in a great bubble to about 95&amp;nbsp;AU, or three times the orbit of [[Pluto]]. The edge of this bubble is known as the [[termination shock]]; the point at which the solar wind collides with the opposing winds of the [[interstellar medium]]. Here the wind slows, condenses and becomes more turbulent, forming a great oval structure known as the [[heliosheath]] that looks and behaves very much like a comet's tail; extending outward for a further 40&amp;nbsp;AU at its stellar-windward side, but tailing many times that distance in the opposite direction. The outer boundary of the sheath, the [[heliopause]], is the point at which the solar wind finally terminates, and one enters the environment of interstellar space.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |year= 2005| title= Voyager: The Interstellar Mission| work=NASA/JPL| url=http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/interstellar.html| accessdate=2006-06-23}} &lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the heliopause, at around 230&amp;nbsp;AU, lies the [[bow shock]], a plasma &quot;wake&quot; left by the Sun as it travels through [[the Milky Way]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |year= 2002| author= P. C. Frisch | title= The Sun's Heliosphere &amp; Heliopause | work=University of Chicago| url=http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap020624.html| accessdate=2006-06-23}} &lt;/ref&gt;

===Sedna===
[[Image:Copy of Sedna.jpg|right|thumb|150px|An artist's conception of Sedna]]
'''[[90377 Sedna|Sedna]]''' is a large, reddish Pluto-like object with a gigantic, highly elliptical orbit that takes it from about 76&amp;nbsp;AU at perihelion to 928&amp;nbsp;AU at aphelion and takes 12,050 years to complete. [[Michael E. Brown|Mike Brown]], who discovered the object in 2003, asserts that it cannot be part of the [[scattered disc]] or the [[Kuiper Belt]] as it has too distant a [[perihelion]] to have been affected by Neptune's migration. He and other astronomers consider it to be the first in an entirely new population, one which also may include the object {{mpl|2000 CR|105}}, which has a perihelion of 45&amp;nbsp;AU, an aphelion of 415&amp;nbsp;AU, and an orbital period of 3420 years.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |year= 2004| author= David Jewitt | title= Sedna - 2003 VB12| work=University of Hawaii| url=http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~jewitt/kb/sedna.html| accessdate=2006-06-23}} &lt;/ref&gt; Sedna is very likely a dwarf planet, though its shape has yet to be determined with certainty.

===Oort cloud===
[[Image:Kuiper oort.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Artist's rendering of the Kuiper Belt and hypothetical [[Oort cloud]].]]
The '''[[Oort cloud]]''', currently only hypothetical, is a great mass of up to a trillion icy objects that is believed to be the source for all long-period [[comets]] and to surround the solar system like a shell from 50,000 to 100,000&amp;nbsp;AU beyond the [[Sun]]. It is believed to be composed of comets which were ejected from the inward Solar System by gravitational interactions with the outer planets. Because the Sun's gravitational hold on them is so weak, Oort cloud objects move only very slowly, though they can be perturbed by such rare events as collisions, or the gravitational effects of a passing star or the [[galactic tides]]. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |year= 2001| author=  Stern SA, Weissman PR.| title= Rapid collisional evolution of comets during the formation of the Oort cloud.| work=Space Studies Department, Southwest Research Institute, Boulder, Colorado| url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=11214311&amp;dopt=Citation| accessdate=2006-11-19}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Galactic context==
[[Image:local_bubble.jpg|200 px|thumb|Artist's conception of the Local Bubble]]
The solar system is located in the [[Milky Way]] [[galaxy]], a [[barred spiral galaxy]] with a diameter estimated at about [[1 E20 m|100,000]] [[light year]]s containing approximately 200 billion stars. Our Sun resides in one of the Milky Way's outer spiral arms, known as the [[Orion Arm]] or [[Local Spur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A comparison of cosmic-ray energy spectra in Galactic spiral arm and interarm regions|author=M J Rogers, M Sadzinska, J Szabelski, D J van der Walt and A W Wolfendale|work=Dept. of Phys.

The bubble is suffused with high-temperature plasma that suggests it is the product of several recent supernovae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Near-Earth Supernovas|work=NASA|url=http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2003/06jan_bubble.htm| accessdate=2006-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
While the orbital speed and radius of the galaxy are not accurately known, estimates place the solar system at between 25,000 and 28,000 light years from the [[galactic center]] and its speed at about 220 [[kilometre per second|kilometres per second]], completing one revolution every [[1 E15 s|225-250 million years]]. This revolution is known as the Solar System's '''galactic year'''. &lt;ref&gt;[http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2002/StacyLeong.shtml Period of the Sun's Orbit around the Galaxy (Cosmic Year)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Milky_Way_Spiral_Arms.png|200px|right|thumb|Presumed location of the solar system within our galaxy]]
The solar system appears to have a very remarkable orbit. It is both extremely close to being circular, and at nearly the exact distance at which the orbital speed matches the speed of the compression waves that form the spiral arms. Evidence suggests that the Solar System has remained between spiral arms for most of the existence of life on Earth. The radiation from [[supernova|supernovae]] in spiral arms could theoretically sterilize planetary surfaces, preventing the formation of complex life, save perhaps in the deepest oceans. The solar system also lies well outside the star-crowded environs of the galactic centre. The opposing gravitational tugs from so many close stars within the galactic centre would have prevented planets from forming.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |year= 2001| author= Leslie Mullen|title=Galactic Habitable Zones| work=Astrobiology Magazine|url=http://www.astrobio.net/news/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=139| accessdate=2006-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are relatively few stars within ten light years (95 trillion&amp;nbsp;km) of the Sun. The closest is the triple star system [[Alpha Centauri]], which is located roughly 4.4 light years away (the outlying star of the triple, [[Proxima Centauri]], is closer, at 4.22 light years). The next closest are the dim [[red dwarf]]s [[Barnard's Star]] (at 6 light years), [[Wolf 359]] (7.8 light years) and [[Lalande 21185]] (8.3 light years). The largest star within ten light years is [[Sirius]], a bright [[blue dwarf]] star roughly twice the Sun's mass and 8.6 light years away. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solstation.com/stars/s10ly.htm SolStation: Stars within ten light years]&lt;/ref&gt; Our closest solitary sunlike star is [[Tau Ceti]], which lies 11.9 light years away. It has roughly 80 percent the Sun's mass, but only 60 percent its luminosity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solstation.com/stars/tau-ceti.htm SolStation: Tau Ceti]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extrasolar systems==

&lt;!-- Please do not add any material to this section unless it directly applies to our Solar System--&gt;
[[Image:Osirisplanet.jpg|150 px|thumb|[[HD 209458 b]], the first extrasolar planet found with the transit method]]
For many years, the Solar System was the only known example of planets in orbit around a star. The discovery in recent years of many [[extrasolar planet]]s has led to the term &quot;solar system&quot; being applied  generically to all the newly discovered systems. Technically, however, it should strictly refer to Earth's system only, as the word &quot;[[solar]]&quot; is derived from the Sun's [[Latin]] name, ''[[Sol]]''. Other such systems are usually referred to by the names of their parent star; e.g.  &quot;the [[Alpha Centauri]] system&quot; or &quot;the [[51 Pegasi]] system&quot;. 

Recent studies of [[extrasolar planet|Extrasolar]] systems neighboring Earth's have shown that our system's configuration might not be common, as the vast majority so far discovered have been found to be markedly different. For instance, many extrasolar planetary systems contain a &quot;[[hot Jupiter]]&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year= 2000|title=The migration and growth of protoplanets in protostellar discs|author=Richard P. Nelson, John C. B. Papaloizou, Frédéric Masset and Willy Kley |work=Royal Astronomical Society|url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/links/doi/10.1046/j.1365-8711.2000.03605.x| accessdate=2006-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; a planet of comparable size to Jupiter that nonetheless orbits very close to its star, at, for instance, 0.05 AU. It has been hypothesised that while the giant planets in these systems formed in the same place as the gas giants in Earth's solar system did, some sort of migration took place which resulted in the giant planet spiralling in towards the parent star. Any terrestrial planets which had previously existed would presumably either be destroyed or ejected from the system.  On the other hand, the apparent prevalence of hot Jupiters could result from a [[sampling error]], as planets of similar size at greater distances from their stars are more difficult to detect.

==Discovery and exploration==
{{main|Geocentric model|Heliocentrism}}

For many thousands of years, people, with a few notable exceptions, did not believe the Solar System existed. The Earth was believed not only to be stationary at the centre of the [[universe]], but to be categorically different from the divine or ethereal objects that moved through the sky. The conceptual advances of the 17th century, led by [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], [[Galileo Galilei]], [[Johannes Kepler]], and [[Isaac Newton]], led gradually to the acceptance of the idea not only that Earth moved round the Sun, but that the planets were governed by the same physical laws that governed the Earth, and therefore could be similar to it.

===Telescopic observations===
{{main|Timeline of solar system astronomy}}
[[Image:Galileo's telescope.jpg|thumb|150 px|Galileo's telescope]]
The first exploration of the solar system was conducted by telescope, with astronomers learning that the Moon and other planets possessed such Earthlike features as craters, ice caps, and seasons.

[[Galileo Galilei]] was the first to discover physical details about the individual bodies of the Solar System. He discovered that the [[Moon]] was cratered, that the Sun was marked with sunspots, and that Jupiter had four satellites in orbit around it.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| title= Galileo Galilei (1564-1642)|author=Eric W. Weisstein
|work=Wolfram Research|year=2006|url=http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/biography/Galileo.html|accessdate=2006-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christiaan Huygens]] followed on from Galileo's discoveries by discovering Saturn's moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] and the shape of the [[rings of Saturn]]. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| title=Discoverer of Titan: Christiaan Huygens
|work=ESA Space Science|year=2005|url=http://www.esa.int/esaSC/SEMJRT57ESD_index_0.html|accessdate=2006-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]] later discovered four more [[Sidera Lodoicea|moons of Saturn]], the [[Rings of Saturn#Cassini Division|Cassini division]] in Saturn's rings, and the [[Great Red Spot]] of Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| title= Giovanni Domenico Cassini (June 8, 1625 - September 14, 1712)|work=SEDS.org|url=http://www.seds.org/messier/Xtra/Bios/cassini.html|accessdate=2006-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1682, [[Edmund Halley]] realised that repeated sightings of a [[comet]] were in fact recording the same object, returning regularly once every 75-6 years. This proved once and for all that comets were not atmospheric phenomena, as had been previously thought, and was the first evidence that anything other than the planets orbited the Sun.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| title=Edmund Halley: Scientific Giant|author=Norma Joan Paul
|work=Historynet.com|url=http://www.historynet.com/exploration/science_engineering/3025646.html?showAll=y&amp;c=y|accessdate=2006-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1781, [[William Herschel]] was looking for binary stars in the constellation of [[Taurus]] when he observed what he thought was a new comet. In fact, its orbit revealed that it was a new planet, [[Uranus]], the first ever discovered.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| title= Herschel, Sir William (1738-1822)|work=enotes.com|url=http://science.enotes.com/earth-science/herschel-sir-william|accessdate=2006-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1801, [[Giuseppe Piazzi]] discovered [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], a small world between Mars and Jupiter that was initially considered a new planet. However, subsequent discoveries of thousands of other small worlds in the same region led to their eventual separate reclassification: [[asteroid]]s.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| title=Discovery of Ceres: 2nd Centenary, 1 January 1801 - 1 January 2001|work=astropa.unipa.it|year=2000|url=http://www.astropa.unipa.it/Asteroids2001/|accessdate=2006-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1846, discrepancies in the orbit of Uranus led many to suspect a large planet must be tugging at it from farther out. [[Urbain Le Verrier]]'s calculations eventually led to the discovery of [[Neptune]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Planets&quot;&gt; {{cite web| title= Mathematical discovery of planets|author=J J O'Connor and E F Robertson|work=St Andrews University|year=1996|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Neptune_and_Pluto.html|accessdate=2006-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Further discrepancies in the orbits of the planets led [[Percival Lowell]] to conclude yet another planet, &quot;[[Planet X]]&quot; must still be out there. After his death, his Lowell Observatory conducted a search, which ultimately led to [[Clyde Tombaugh]]'s discovery of [[Pluto]] in 1930. Pluto was, however, found to be too small to have disrupted the orbits of the outer planets, and its discovery was therefore coincidental.  Like Ceres, it was initially considered to be a planet, but after the discovery of many other similarly sized objects in its vicinity it was eventually reclassified as a [[dwarf planet]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Planets&quot; /&gt;

In 1992, astronomers [[David Jewitt]] of the [[University of Hawaii]]  and [[Jane Luu]] of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] discovered [[1992 QB1]], the first object found beyond Neptune in 62 years. This object proved to be the first of a new population, which came to be known as the [[Kuiper Belt]]; an icy analogue to the asteroid belt of which such objects as Pluto and Charon were deemed a part.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| title= KUIPER BELT OBJECTS: Relics from the Accretion Disk of the Sun|author=Jane X. Luu ­and David C. Jewitt ­|work=[[MIT]], [[University of Hawaii]]|year=2002|url=http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.astro.40.060401.093818|accessdate=2006-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| title= List of Trans-Neptunian Objects|author=[[Minor Planet Center]]|url=http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/lists/TNOs.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, [[Michael E. Brown|Mike Brown]], [[Chad Trujillo]] and [[David Rabinowitz]] announced the discovery of [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], a [[Scattered disc object]] larger than Pluto and the largest object discovered in orbit round the Sun since Neptune.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| title=Eris (2003 UB313|work=Solstation.com|year=2006|url=http://www.solstation.com/stars/ub313.htm|accessdate=2006-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Observations by spacecraft===
{{main|Space exploration}}
[[Image:PaleBlueDot.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Pale Blue Dot]] photo, a photo of [[Earth]] as a tiny dot (taken 4 billion miles from Earth by [[Voyager 1]] at the edge of the solar system)]]Since the start of the [[space age]], a great deal of exploration has been performed by [[unmanned space missions]] that have been organized and executed by various space agencies. The first probe to [[Landings on other planets|land on another solar system body]] was the [[Soviet Union]]'s ''[[Luna 2]]'' probe, which impacted on the Moon in 1959. Since then, increasingly distant planets have been reached, with probes landing on [[Venus (planet)|Venus]] in 1965, [[Mars (planet)|Mars]] in 1976, the asteroid [[433 Eros]] in 2001, and [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] in 2005. Spacecraft have also made close approaches to other planets: ''[[Mariner 10]]'' passed [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] in 1973.

The first probe to explore the outer planets was ''[[Pioneer 10]]'', which flew by [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]] in 1973. ''[[Pioneer 11]]'' was the first to visit [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]], in 1979. The [[Voyager program|''Voyager'']] probes performed a grand tour of the outer planets following their launch in 1977, with both probes passing Jupiter in 1979 and Saturn in 1980 &amp;ndash; 1981. ''[[Voyager 2]]'' then went on to make close approaches to [[Uranus (planet)|Uranus]] in 1986 and [[Neptune (planet)|Neptune]] in 1989. The ''Voyager'' probes are now far beyond [[Neptune (planet)|Neptune]]'s orbit, and astronomers anticipate that they will encounter the [[heliopause]] which defines the outer edge of the solar system in the next few years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year= 2005| title=Voyager Interstellar Mission| Author=NASA/JPL| url=http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/interstellar.html| accessdate=2006-07-01}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |year= 2002| title= Time Line of Space Exploration| Author= Randy Culp| url=http://my.execpc.com/~culp/space/timeline.html| accessdate=2006-07-01}} &lt;/ref&gt;

All planets in the solar system have now been visited to varying degrees by spacecraft launched from Earth, the last being Neptune in 1989.  Through these unmanned missions, humans have been able to get close-up photographs of all of the planets and, in the case of landers, perform tests of the soils and [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmospheres]] of some.

No [[Kuiper belt object]] has been visited by a spacecraft. Launched in [[19 January]], [[2006]], the ''[[New Horizons]]'' is currently enroute to becoming the first man-made spacecraft to explore this area. This [[Unmanned spacecraft|unmanned mission]] is scheduled to fly by Pluto in July 2015. Should it prove feasible, the mission will then be extended to observe a number of other Kuiper belt objects.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |year= 2006| title= New Horizons NASA's Pluto-Kuiper Belt Mission| url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/| accessdate=2006-07-01}} &lt;/ref&gt;

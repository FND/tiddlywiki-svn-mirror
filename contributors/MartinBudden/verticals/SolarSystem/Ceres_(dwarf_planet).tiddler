Hence we can't say the Minor Planet Centre calls it that.--&gt; is the smallest [[dwarf planet]] in the [[Solar System]] and the only one located in the [[asteroid belt]]. Its name is derived from the [[Roman mythology|Roman]] [[goddess]] [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] &amp;mdash; the goddess of growing plants and of motherly love. It was discovered on [[January 1]] [[1801]], by [[Giuseppe Piazzi]]. With a diameter of about 950 km, Ceres is by far the [[List of noteworthy asteroids|largest]] and most massive body in the asteroid belt, and contains approximately a third of the belt's total mass. Recent observations have revealed that it is spherical, unlike the irregular shapes of smaller asteroids with less gravity.\n\n==Name==\n[[Image:Piazzi Cerere.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Piazzi's Book ''&quot;Della scoperta del nuovo pianeta Cerere Ferdinandea&quot;'' outlining the discovery of Ceres]]\nCeres was originally named '''Ceres Ferdinandea''' ('''Cerere Ferdinandea''') after both the mythological figure [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] ([[Roman mythology|Roman goddess]] of plants and motherly love) and [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|King Ferdinand III of Sicily]]. &quot;Ferdinandea&quot; was not acceptable to other nations of the world and was thus dropped. Ceres was also called '''[[Hera]]''' for a short time in [[Germany]]. In Greece, it is called Δήμητρα ([[Demeter]]), after the goddess Ceres' Greek equivalent; in English usage, Demeter is the name of a different asteroid ([[1108 Demeter]]).\n\nDue to the rarity of the usage, there is no consensus as to the proper adjectival form of the name, although the [[Nonce word|nonce forms]] ''Cerian'' and ''Cerean'' have been used in fiction.\n\n==== Symbol ====\nCeres' [[Astronomical symbols|astronomical symbol]] is a [[sickle]] ([[Image:Ceres symbol.svg|20px|Sickle variant symbol of Ceres]]), similar to [[Venus]]' symbol ([[Image:Venus symbol.svg|22px|Astronomical symbol of Venus]]) which is the female gender symbol and Venus' hand mirror. There have been several variants of the sickle design, including [[Image:1 Ceres (0).png|10px|Old symbol of Ceres]], [[Image:1 Ceres (1).png|10px|Mirror variant symbol of Ceres]] and [[Image:1 Ceres (3).png|13px|Other sickle variant symbol of Ceres]].\n\n==Discovery==\nPiazzi was searching for a star listed by Francis Wollaston as Mayer 87 because it was not in Mayer's zodiacal catalogue in the position given. Instead, Piazzi found a moving star-like object, which he thought at first was a [[comet]].\n\nPiazzi observed Ceres a total of 24 times, the final time on [[February 11]], when illness interrupted. On [[January 24]] [[1801]], Piazzi announced his discovery in letters to fellow astronomers, among them his fellow countryman, [[Barnaba Oriani]] of [[Milan]]. He reported it as a comet but &quot;since its movement is so slow and rather uniform, it has occurred to me several times that it might be something better than a comet&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.astropa.unipa.it/versione_inglese/Hystory/BODE'S_LAW.htm#8a| title=8.

Vaiana}}&lt;/ref&gt; By early February Ceres was lost as it receded behind the [[Sun]]. In April, Piazzi sent his complete observations to Oriani, [[Johann Elert Bode|Bode]], and [[Jérôme Lalande|Lalande]] in [[Paris]]. They were shortly thereafter published in the September, 1801 issue of the ''Monatliche Correspondenz''.\n\nTo recover Ceres, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], then only 24 years old, developed a method of orbit determination from three observations. In only a few weeks, he predicted its path, and sent his results to [[Franz Xaver, Baron von Zach]], the editor of the ''Monatliche Correspondenz''. On [[December 31]] [[1801]], von Zach and [[Heinrich W. M. Olbers]] unambiguously confirmed the recovery of Ceres.\n\n==Status==\n[[Image:Confronto_Ceres_Lua.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Ceres (left) in comparison with the [[Moon]] (right).]]\n[[Johann Elert Bode]] believed Ceres to be the &quot;missing [[planet]]&quot; that [[Johann Daniel Titius]] had proposed to exist between [[Mars]] and [[Jupiter]], at a distance of 419 million km (2.8 AU) from the Sun. Ceres was assigned a planetary symbol, and remained listed as a planet in astronomy books and tables (along with [[2 Pallas]], [[3 Juno]] and [[4 Vesta]]) for about half a century until further asteroids were discovered. Due to Ceres' small size, its relatively high inclination, and its sharing an orbital region with [[2 Pallas]], Sir [[William Herschel]] coined in 1802 the term ''[[asteroid]]'' (&quot;star-like&quot;) for such bodies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/hilton/AsteroidHistory/minorplanets.html| first=Dr. J. L. | last=Hilton| title=When Did the Asteroids Become Minor Planets?| year=[[September 17]] [[2001]]| accessdate = 2006-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;, writing, &quot;they resemble small stars so much as hardly to be distinguished from them, even by very good telescopes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0261-0523%281802%2992%3C213%3AOOTTLD%3E2.0.CO%3B2-R| first=William | last=Herschel| title=''Observations on the two lately discovered celestial Bodies.''| year=[[May 6]] [[1802]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe 2006 debate surrounding [[Pluto]] and what constitutes a 'planet' led to Ceres being considered for reclassification as a planet. An unsuccessful proposal before the [[International Astronomical Union]] for the [[definition of a planet]] would have defined a planet as &quot;a celestial body that (a) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and (b) is in orbit around a star, and is neither a star nor a satellite of a planet&quot;. Had this resolution been adopted, this would have made Ceres the fifth planet in order from the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/The_IAU_Draft_Definition_Of_Planets_And_Plutons_999.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, the new definition of 'planet' is &quot;a celestial body that is in orbit around the sun, has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a ... nearly round shape, and has cleared the neighborhood around its orbit.&quot;  By this definition, Ceres (along with Pluto) cannot be classified as a planet, and both are now classified as &quot;[[dwarf planet]]s&quot;.\n\nThe classification of Ceres has changed more than once. At the time of its discovery it was considered a [[planet]], but upon the realization that it represented the first of a class of many similar bodies, it was reclassified as an [[asteroid]] for over 150 years. As the first such body to be discovered, it was given the designation 1 Ceres under the modern system of [[Asteroid#Naming asteroids|asteroid numbering]]. After the discovery of the [[trans-Neptunian object]] {{dp|Eris}}, the [[International Astronomical Union]] put forward a proposal to once again define Ceres as a planet, along with {{dp|Eris}} and {{dp|Pluto}}'s moon [[Charon (moon)|Charon]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iau2006.org/mirror/www.iau.org/iau0601/iau0601_release.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/news/science/la-sci-planets16aug16,0,3652893.story?coll=la-home-headlines?invade Proposal would increase from 9 to 12&lt;/ref&gt; This draft definition was not accepted, and in its place an alternate [[Definition of planet|definition of &quot;planet&quot;]] came into effect as of [[August 24]], [[2006]]. Under this definition, Ceres is a 'dwarf planet', although it remains unclear as to whether or not it is also classified as an asteroid.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iau2006.org/mirror/www.iau.org/iau0603/iau0603_Q_A2.html &quot;Ceres '''was''' an asteroid&quot; - but note it then talks about &quot;'''other''' asteroids&quot; crossing Ceres' path.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[Image:Ceres_Orbit.svg|thumb|left|300px|Orbit of Ceres]]\n==Orbit==\nCeres follows an orbit between Mars and Jupiter, within the main [[asteroid belt]], with a period of 4.6 years. The orbit is moderately inclined (i=10.6° to be compared with 7° for Mercury and 17° for Pluto) and moderately [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentric]] (e=0.08 to compare with 0.09 for Mars).\n\n\nThe diagram illustrates the orbits of Ceres (blue) and several planets (white/grey). The segments of orbits below the ecliptic are plotted in darker colours, and the orange plus sign is the Sun's location. The top left diagram is a polar view that shows the location of Ceres in the gap between Mars and Jupiter. The top right is a close-up demonstrating the locations of the [[pericenter|perihelia]] (q) and [[apocenter|aphelia]] (Q) of Ceres and Mars. Interestingly, the perihelia of Ceres (as well as those of several other of the largest MBAs) and Mars are on the opposite sides of the Sun. The bottom diagram is a perspective view showing the inclination of the orbit of Ceres compared to the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.\n\n==Physical characteristics==\n[[Image:Ceres Rotation.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Hubble Space Telescope]] images of Ceres, taken in 2003/4 with a resolution of about 30 km. The nature of the bright spot is uncertain. A movie was also made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| publisher=Astronomy| url=http://www.astronomy.com/asy/default.aspx?c=a&amp;id=3478| title= An icy interior for Ceres?| first=Bill| last= Cooke| date=[[September 12]] [[2005]]}} movie credit J.

The &quot;Piazzi&quot; feature is the dark spot in the center.]]\nCeres is the largest object in the [[asteroid belt]], which mostly lies between [[Mars (planet)|Mars]] and [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]]. However, it is not the largest object besides the Sun, planets and their satellites, in the solar system: the [[Kuiper belt]] is known to contain larger objects, including [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], [[Pluto]], [[50000 Quaoar]], [[90482 Orcus]], and [[90377 Sedna]].\n\nAt certain points in its orbit, Ceres can reach a magnitude of 7.0. This is generally regarded as being just barely too dim to be seen with the naked eye, but under exceptional viewing conditions a very sharp-sighted person may be able to see the asteroid with the naked eye. The only other asteroid that can be seen with the naked eye is [[4 Vesta]].\n\nCeres' size and mass are sufficient to give it a nearly spherical shape.  That is, it is close to [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]. Other large asteroids such as [[2 Pallas]], [[3 Juno]], and [[4 Vesta]] are known to be quite irregular, while lightcurve analysis of [[10 Hygiea]] indicates it is oblong although it appears spheroidal in low-resolution images (presumably due to viewing angle). \n\nWith a mass of 9.5{{e|20}}&amp;nbsp;kg, Ceres comprises about a third of the estimated total 3.0±0.2{{e|21}}&amp;nbsp;kg mass of all the asteroids in the solar system&lt;ref name=&quot;Pitjeva2005&quot;&gt;[http://iau-comm4.jpl.nasa.gov/EPM2004.pdf E. V. Pitjeva ''High-Precision Ephemerides of Planets — EPM and Determination of Some Astronomical Constants''], Solar System Resarch, Vol. 39 pp. 176 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; (note how all these amount to only about 4% of the mass of the [[Moon]]).\n\nThere are some indications that the surface of Ceres is relatively warm and that it may have a tenuous [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]] and [[frost]]. The maximum temperature with the [[Sun]] overhead was estimated from measurements to be 235&amp;nbsp;[[kelvin|K]] (about -38&amp;nbsp;°[[celsius|C]]) on [[May 5]] [[1991]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Saint-Pe1993&quot;/&gt; Taking into account also the [[heliocentric]] distance at the time, this gives an estimated maximum of ~239 K at [[perihelion]].\n\n[[Image:Ceres Cutaway.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Diagram showing differentiated layers of Ceres]]\n\nA study led by Peter Thomas of [[Cornell University]] suggests that Ceres has a differentiated interior: observations coupled with computer models suggest the presence of a rocky core overlain with an icy [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]]. This mantle of thickness from 120 to 60&amp;nbsp;km could contain 200 million cubic kilometres of water, which is more than the amount of [[fresh water]] on the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://space.com/scienceastronomy/050907_ceres_planet.html| title=Largest Asteroid Might Contain More Fresh Water than Earth| first=Bjorn| lat= Carey| publisher=SPACE.com| date=07 September 2005| accessdate = 2006-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas2005&quot;/&gt;\n\nThere has been some ambiguity regarding surface features on Ceres. Low resolution [[ultraviolet]] [[Hubble Space Telescope]] images taken in 1995 showed a dark spot on its surface which was nicknamed &quot;Piazzi&quot; in honour of the discoverer of Ceres. This was thought to be a crater. Later images with a higher resolution taken over a whole rotation with the [[Keck telescope]] using [[adaptive optics]] showed no sign of &quot;Piazzi&quot;. However, two dark features were seen to move with the asteroid's rotation, one with a bright central region. These are presumably craters. More recent visible light [[Hubble Space Telescope]] images of a full rotation taken in 2003 and 2004 show an enigmatic white spot, the nature of which is currently unknown.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hubbl12003-4&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/2005/27/| title= Largest Asteroid May Be 'Mini Planet' with Water Ice | date=[[September 7]] [[2005]] | accessdate = 2006-08-16| publisher=HubbleSite}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dark albedo features seen with Keck are, however, not immediately recognizable in these images.\n\nThese last observations also determined that Ceres' north pole points (give or take about 5°) in the direction of [[right ascension]] 19 h 24 min, [[declination]] +59°, in the [[constellation]] [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]]. This means that Ceres' [[axial tilt]] is very small (about 4±5°).&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas2005&quot;/&gt;\n\nCeres was long thought to be the parent body of the &quot;Ceres [[asteroid family]]&quot;. However, that grouping is now defunct because Ceres has been shown to be an interloper in its &quot;own&quot; family, and physically unrelated. The bulk of that asteroid group is now called the [[Gefion family]].\n\n==Observations==\nSome notable observation milestones for Ceres include:\n\nAn [[occultation]] of a [[star]] by Ceres was observed in [[Mexico]], [[Florida]] and across the [[Caribbean]] on [[November 13]] [[1984]].\n\nFeatures on Ceres' surface have been telescopically imaged several times in recent years.\n\nThese include:\n* [[Ultraviolet]] [[Hubble Space Telescope]] images with 50 km resolution taken in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.swri.org/press/ceres.htm| title=Observations reveal curiosities on the surface of asteroid Ceres| accessdate = 2006-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Parker2002&quot;&gt;J.

According to the current mission profile, Dawn is expected to explore the asteroid [[4 Vesta]] in 2011 before arriving at Ceres in 2015.\n\n==Namesakes==\n* The chemical element [[cerium]] (atomic number 58) was discovered in 1803 by [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius|Berzelius]] and [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth|Klaproth]], working independently. Berzelius named the element after Ceres. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.webelements.com/webelements/elements/text/Ce/hist.html| title=Cerium Historical Information| accessdate = 2006-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n* [[William Hyde Wollaston]] discovered [[palladium]] (atomic number 46) as early as 1802 and at first called it ''Ceresium''. By the time he openly published his discovery in 1805, the name was already taken (by Berzelius) and he switched it to palladium in honour of [[2 Pallas]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://alchemy.chem.uwm.edu/amalgamator/features/feat2003/features.html#yag| title=Amalgamator Features 2003: 200 Years Ago| accessdate = 2006-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Aspects==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;\n|- align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;align:center; background:#ffc0c0&quot;\n !

<div tiddler="Scattered disc" modifier="Wikipedia" modified="200608120000" created="200608120000" tags="MediaWikiFormat">The '''scattered disc''' (or '''scattered disk''') is a distant region of our [[solar system]], thinly populated by icy [[planetoid]]s known as '''scattered disc objects''' (SDOs), a subset of the broader family of [[trans-Neptunian object]]s (TNOs).  The innermost portion of the scattered disc overlaps with the [[Kuiper belt]], but its outer limits extend much farther away from the [[Sun]] and above and below the [[ecliptic]] than the belt proper.  \n{{TNO}}\n\n==Formation==\nThe scattered disk is still poorly understood, although prevailing astronomical opinion suggests it was formed when [[Kuiper belt]] objects (KBOs) were &quot;scattered&quot; by gravitational interactions with the outer planets, principally [[Neptune]], into highly-[[eccentricity (orbit)|eccentric]] and -[[inclination|inclined]] orbits.  While the Kuiper belt is a relatively &quot;round&quot; and &quot;flat&quot; doughnut of space extending from about 30 AU to 44 AU with its member-objects locked in autonomously circular orbits ([[cubewano]]s) or mildly-elliptical [[orbital resonance|resonant]] orbits ([[plutino]]s and [[twotino]]s), the scattered disc is by comparison a much more erratic milieu.  SDOs can often, as in the case of {{mpl|2003 UB|313}} &quot;Xena&quot;, travel almost as great a &quot;vertical&quot; distance as they do relative to what has come to be defined as &quot;horizontal&quot;.  Orbital simulations show SDO orbits may well be erratic and unstable and that the ultimate fate of these objects is to be permanently ejected from the core of the solar system into the [[Oort cloud]] or beyond.  \n\nThere is an emerging sense that [[centaur (planetoid)|centaur]]s may simply be objects just like SDOs that were knocked inwards from the Kuiper belt rather than outwards, making them simply &quot;non-trans-Neptunian&quot; SDOs&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zanestein.com/page4_1.htm ''What are the Centaurs?''], part of ''Chiron's Friends'' by Zane Stein.&lt;/ref&gt;.\nIndeed, some objects like {{mpl|(29981) 1999 TD|10}} blur the distinction, and the [[Minor Planet Center]] (MPC) now lists centaurs and SDOs together&lt;ref&gt;[http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/lists/Centaurs.html ''List Of Centaurs and Scattered-Disk Objects''] at the ''IAU: Minor Planet Center''&lt;/ref&gt;.\nIn recognition of this blurring of categorization, some scientists use &quot;'''scattered kuiper belt object'''&quot; (or SKBO) as an umbrella term for both centaurs and member bodies of the scattered disc.\n\nAlthough the TNO [[90377 Sedna]] is officially considered an SDO by the MPC, its discoverer [[Michael E. Brown]] has suggested that because its [[perihelion]] distance of 76 AU is too distant to be affected by the gravitational attraction of the outer planets it should be considered an inner Oort cloud object rather than a member of the scattered disk &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/sedna/ ''Sedna''] at ''www.gps.caltech.edu''&lt;/ref&gt;.\nThis line of thinking suggests that a lack of gravitational interaction with the outer planets disqualifies a TNO from scattered disc membership, which would create an outer edge somewhere between Sedna and more conventional SDOs like {{mp|2003 UB|313}}.  If Sedna is beyond the scattered disk, it may not be not unique; {{mpl|2000 CR|105}}, which was discovered before Sedna, may also be an inner Oort cloud object or (more likely) a transitional object between the scattered disc and the inner Oort cloud.\n\nSuch objects referred to as [[#Detached objects, or an extended scattered disc?|''Detached'']], have orbits which cannot be created by Neptune scattering. Instead, a number of explanations have been put  forward including a passing star (Morbidelli 2004&lt;ref name=&quot;Morbidelli 2004&quot; &gt;\nAlessandro Morbidelli and Harold F. Levison\n''Scenarios for the Origin of the Orbits of the Trans-Neptunian Objects 2000 CR105 and 2003 VB12 (Sedna)''\nThe Astronomical Journal, (2004) '''128''', pp 2564-2576.

Matese, and Jack J. Lissauer\n''A Distant Planetary-Mass Solar Companion May Have Produced Distant Detached Objects''\nTo appear in Icarus (2006). [http://staff.on.br/rodneyg/companion/solar_companion.pdf Preprint]\n&lt;/ref&gt;)\nSee [[90377 Sedna#Orbital characteristics|Sedna]].\n\n== Orbits ==\n[[Image:TheKuiperBelt_100AU_SDO.svg|right|thumb|400px|Scattered disk and [[Kuiper Belt]] objects.]]\nThe first SDO to be recognized was {{mpl|(15874) 1996 TL|66}}, first identified in [[1996]] by astronomers based at [[Mauna Kea]]. The first object presently classified as an SDO to be discovered was {{mpl|(48639) 1995 TL|8}}, found by [[Spacewatch]].\n\nThe diagram on the right illustrates the orbits of all known scattered disk objects up to 100AU together with Kuiper belt objects (in grey) and resonant objects (in green). The [[eccentricity (orbit)|eccentricity]] of the orbits is represented by segments (extending from the [[perihelion]] to the [[aphelion]]) with the [[inclination]] represented on Y axis. \n=== Perihelia ===\nTypically, the scattered objects are characterised by orbits with medium and high eccentricities but their perihelia bring them no closer than 35AU, clear from direct influence of Neptune (red segments). Plutinos (grey segments for Pluto and Orcus) as well as resonant object at 2:5 (in green) can approach Neptune closer as their orbits are protected by resonances. This '''perihelion &gt; 35 AU''' condition is actually one of the defining characteristics of scattered objects.\n\n=== Extremes ===\nThe scattered disc is the place where extreme eccentricity and high inclination appears to be the norm and circular orbits are exceptional. Some exceptional orbits are plotted in yellow\n\n*{{mp|1999 TD|10}} has an orbit with extreme eccentricity (~0.9), bringing its perihelion near Saturn's orbit. This could qualify it as a [[Centaur (planetoid)|Centaur]].\n*{{mp|2002 XU|93}} is currently the object with the highest inclination (~78&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;) in the Scattered Disc. \n*{{mpl|2004 XR|190}} has the atypical, near circular (the short yellow segment) orbit, but it is highly inclined.\n\n=== Some order in the chaos? ===\nResonant objects (shown in green), are not considered to be members of the scattered disk. Minor  resonances are also populated and some computer simulations show that many objects could be actually on weak, higher order resonances (6:11,4:9,3:7,5:12,3:8,2:7,1:4).

Malhotra R.''Neptune's migration into a stirred-up Kuiper Belt'' The Astronomical Journal, '''130''', pp.2392-2414, Nov.2005.[http://www.arxiv.org/PS_cache/astro-ph/pdf/0507/0507319.pdf Full text on arXiv]. &lt;/ref&gt;: ''the scattered disk might not be so scattered'' after all.\n\n=== Scattered objects versus classical objects ===\n[[Image:TheKuiperBelt_100AU_SDO_stats.svg|right|thumb|400px|Scattered objects compared with the classical objects.]]\n\nThe inserts in the diagram on the right compare the eccentricity and inclination of the scattered disk population to the cubewanos. Each small coloured square represents a given range for both the eccentricity '''e''' and the inclination '''i''' &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.  The relative number of objects within the square is represented with ''cartographic'' colours&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (from small numbers plotted as green ''valleys'' to brown ''peaks''). \n\nThe two populations are very different: more than 30% of all cubewanos are on low inclination, near circular orbits (the low bottom corner 'peak') and their eccentricity peaks at 0.25. Scattered objects on the other hand are, well, ''scattered''. The majority of the known population have medium eccentricity in 0.25-0.55. Two local peaks correspond to '''e''' in the 0.25--0.35 range, inclination 15-20&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; and '''e'''=0.5--0.55, low '''i'''&lt;10&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; respectively. The extreme orbits show up as outliers in grey. \nCharacteristically, there are no known SDO objects with eccentricity lower than 0.3 (with the exception of {{mpl|2004 XR|190}}).\n\nIt is the eccentricity, more than the orbit's inclination, that is the distinctive attribute of the family of scattered objects.\n\n&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;As near-circular orbits occupy the first column (e&lt;0.05) and the orbits with the lowest inclination (i&lt;5 degrees) occupy the lowest row, the square in the bottom left corner represents the number of near circular, very lowly inclined orbits.&lt;/small&gt;\n\n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;A grey square represents a  single object (an outlier) in this range.&lt;/small&gt;\n\n&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;\n\n=== Orbit plots ===\n[[Image:TheKuiperBelt_Projections_100AU_Classical_SDO.svg|left|thumb|240px|Orbit projections.]]\nMore traditional, the graph on the left represents polar and ecliptic views of the (aligned) orbits of the scattered disk objects &lt;ref&gt;Minor Planet Circular 2005-X77 [http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/mpec/K05/K05X77.html Distant Minor planets] was used for orbit classification.

As yet unclassified objects in 50-100AU region are plotted in grey &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.\n\nThe solid blue ring is not an artist's representation but a real plot of hundreds overlapping orbits of the classical objects, fully deserving the name of the main (classical or cubewanos) '''belt'''. The ''minimum perihelion'' mentioned above is illustrated by the red circle. Unlike SDOs, the resonant objects approach Neptune’s orbit (in gold) .\n\nOn the ecliptic view, the arcs represent the same ''minimum perihelion''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of 35AU (red)  and Neptune’s orbit (at ~30AU, in yellow). As this view illustrates, the inclinations alone do not really distinguish SDO from the classical objects. Instead, the eccentricity is the distinctive attribute (long aphelion segments).\n\n&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;For roughly a half of known TNO the orbits are not yet known with the precision sufficient for the classification (a particularly delicate task for resonant objects).&lt;/small&gt;\n\n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;The precise value is not too important; the value of 35 AU is quoted for coherence with Jewitt. &lt;ref name=Jewitt2006&gt;D.Jewitt, A.Delsanti ''The Solar System Beyond The Planets'', in ''Solar System Update : Topical and Timely Reviews in Solar System Sciences '', Springer-Praxis Ed., ISBN 3540260560  (2006).

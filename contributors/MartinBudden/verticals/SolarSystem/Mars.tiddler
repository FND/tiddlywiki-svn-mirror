It is named after Mars, the [[Roman mythology|Roman god]] of war. Mars is also known as &quot;The Red Planet&quot; due to its reddish night time appearance when seen from Earth. The prefix ''areo-'', from the [[Greek mythology|Greek god]] of war, [[Ares]], refers to Mars in the same way ''geo-'' refers to Earth — for example, ''areology'' versus ''[[geology]]''.\n\nUntil the first flyby of Mars by [[Mariner 4]] in 1965, it was thought that Mars had channels of liquid water. Observations later showed that these channels do not exist. Still, of any planet in our solar system after the [[Earth]], Mars is the most likely to harbor liquid [[water]], and perhaps [[life]]. It also has seasonal cycles that are similar to the ones on Earth. It also has a [[rotational period]] nearly the same as our own. It has the highest [[mountain]] in the solar system, [[Olympus Mons]], the largest canyon in the solar system, [[Valles Marineris]], and [[polar ice caps]].\n\nMars has two [[natural satellite|moon]]s, [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] and [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]], which are small and oddly-shaped. These may be captured [[asteroid]]s such as [[5261 Eureka]].  Mars can be seen from [[Earth]] by the [[naked eye]] with a brightness of up to -2.9 [[Apparent magnitude|magnitude]], only surpassed by [[Venus]], the Moon and the Sun.\n\nMars is currently host to four orbiting [[spacecraft]] and the two [[Mars Exploration Rover]]s, many more than any planet, other than Earth.\n\n==Physical characteristics==\nThe fiery appearance of Mars is caused by [[iron(III) oxide]] (rust) on its surface.&lt;ref name=rust&gt;Peplow, Mark, [http://www.nature.com/news/2004/040503/full/040503-6.html;jsessionid=2E40E6D0BDA9D25A3BAF1DFC53F9FA40 &quot;How Mars got its rust&quot;] - 6 May 2004 article from [http://www.nature.com Nature.com].

There is some evidence that a portion of the Martian surface might be more silica-rich than typical basalt, perhaps similar to [[andesitic]] rocks on Earth, though these observations may also be explained by silica glass.  Much of the surface is deeply covered by dust as fine as talcum powder. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://erc.arc.nasa.gov/MarsVolc/basalt.htm|title=NASA Mars Page|work=Volcanology of Mars|accessdate=June 13|accessyear=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nObservations of the [[magnetic field]]s on Mars have revealed that parts of the planet's [[Crust (geology)|crust]] have been magnetized.  This magnetization has been compared to alternating bands found on the ocean floors of Earth.  One theory, published in 1999 and reexamined in October 2005 with the help of the [[Mars Global Surveyor]], is that these bands are evidence of the past operation of [[plate tectonics]] on Mars.&lt;ref name=plates&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2005/mgs_plates.html &quot;New Map Provides More Evidence Mars Once Like Earth&quot;] - Oct. 12, 2005 [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] Press release.

This [[iron sulfide]] core is partially fluid, with twice the concentration of light elements as exist at the Earth's core. This is surrounded by a silicate [[mantle]] that formed many of the tectonic and volcanic features on the planet, but now appears to be inactive. The average thickness of the planet's crust is about 50 km, and it is no thicker than 125 km.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news |author = Dave Jacqué |url = http://www.anl.gov/Media_Center/News/2003/030926mars.htm |title = APS X-rays reveal secrets of Mars' core | publisher = Argonne National Laboratory | date = 2003-09-26 | accessdate = 2006-07-01 | language = English }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Geography===\n{{main|Areography|:Category:Surface features of Mars|List of mountains on Mars|List of craters on Mars}}\n[[Image:MarsTopoMap-PIA02031 modest.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Topographic map of Mars. Notable features include the [[Tharsis]] volcanoes in the west (including [[Olympus Mons]]), [[Valles Marineris]] to the east of Tharsis, and [[Hellas Basin]] in the southern hemisphere.]]\nAlthough better remembered for mapping the [[Moon]] starting in 1830, [[Johann Heinrich Mädler]] and [[Wilhelm Beer]] were the first &quot;areographers&quot;. They started off by establishing once and for all that most of the surface features were permanent, and pinned down Mars' rotation period. In 1840, Mädler combined ten years of observations and drew the first ever map of Mars. Rather than giving names to the various markings they mapped, Beer and Mädler simply designated them with letters; Meridian Bay (Sinus Meridiani) was thus feature &quot;a&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uapress.arizona.edu/onlinebks/mars/chap04.htm |title= Areographers |work= The Planet Mars:\nA History of Observation and Discovery| accessdate=2006-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nToday, features on Mars are named from a number of sources. Large [[albedo]] features retain many of the older names, but are often updated to reflect new knowledge of the nature of the features. For example 'Nix Olympica' (the snows of Olympus) has become ''Olympus Mons'' (Mount Olympus).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iomoon.com/olympus.htm |title= Olympus Mons (Nix Olympica) |work= Iomoon.com| accessdate=2006-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nMars' equator is defined by its rotation, but the location of its [[Prime Meridian]] was specified, as was Earth's, by choice of an arbitrary point. Mädler and Beer selected a line in 1830 for their first maps of Mars. After the spacecraft [[Mariner 9]] provided extensive imagery of Mars in 1972, a small crater (later called [[Airy-0]]), located in the [[Sinus Meridiani]] ('Middle Bay' or 'Meridian Bay'), was chosen for the definition of 0.0° longitude to coincide with the originally selected line. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.absoluteastronomy.com/a/airy-0 |title= Airy-0 |work= Absolute Astronomy| accessdate=2006-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nSince Mars has no oceans and hence no 'sea level', a zero-elevation surface or [[mean gravity surface]] must be selected. The zero altitude is defined by the height at which there is 610.5 [[Pascal|Pa]] (6.105 mbar) of atmospheric pressure (approximately 0.6% of Earth's). This pressure corresponds to the [[triple point]] of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crystalinks.com/mars2.html|title= Topography|work=Physical Mars|accessdate=June 13|accessyear=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[Image:Mars.jpg|thumb|right|Mars, 2001, with polar ice caps visible.]]\n\nThe dichotomy of Martian topography is striking: northern plains flattened by lava flows contrast with the southern highlands, pitted and cratered by ancient impacts. The surface of Mars as seen from Earth is thus divided into two kinds of areas, with differing albedo. The paler plains covered with dust and sand rich in reddish iron oxides were once thought of as Martian 'continents' and given names like [[Arabia Terra]] (''land of Arabia'') or [[Amazonis Planitia]] (''Amazonian plain''). The dark features were thought to be seas, hence their names [[Mare Erythraeum]], [[Mare Sirenum]] and [[Aurorae Sinus]]. The largest dark feature seen from Earth is [[Syrtis Major]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/S/SyrtisMajor.html|title=Syrtis Major|work=Encyclopedia of Astrobiology, Astronomy &amp; Spaceflight|accessdate=June 13|accessyear=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe  [[shield volcano|shield]] [[volcano]], [[Olympus Mons]] (''Mount Olympus''), is the highest known mountain in the solar system, at 26 km. It is in the vast upland region Tharsis, which contains several large volcanos. The Tharsis region of Mars also has the solar system's largest canyon system, [[Valles Marineris]] or the ''[[Mariner program|Mariner]] Valley'', which is 4000 km long and 7 km deep. Mars is also scarred by a number of [[impact crater]]s.  The largest of these is the [[Hellas Planitia|Hellas impact basin]], covered with light red sand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/mars/interior/Martian_global_geology.html|title=Mars Global Geography|work=Windows to the Universe|accessdate=June 13|June 13|accessyear=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Moons===\n{{main|Mars' natural satellites}}\nMars has two tiny natural moons, [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] and [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]], which orbit very close to the planet and are thought to be captured asteroids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=31031|title=Close Inspection for Phobos|work=ESA website|accesdate=June 13|accessyear=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nBoth satellites were discovered in 1877 by [[Asaph Hall]], and are named after the characters [[Phobos (mythology)|Phobos]] (panic/fear) and [[Deimos (mythology)|Deimos]] (terror/dread) who, in Greek mythology, accompanied their father Ares, god of war, into battle. Ares was known as Mars to the Romans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/AresAttendants.html|title=ARES ATTENDANTS: DEIMOS &amp; PHOBOS|work=Greek Mythology|accesdate=June 13|accessyear=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nFrom the surface of Mars, the motions of Phobos and Deimos appear very different from that of our own moon. Phobos rises in the west, sets in the east, and rises again in just 11 hours, while Deimos, being only just outside synchronous orbit, rises as expected in the east but very slowly. Despite its 30 hour orbit, it takes 2.7 days to set in the west as it slowly falls behind the rotation of Mars, and as long again to rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nineplanets.org/phobos.html|title=Phobos|work=nineplanets|accesdate=June 13|accessyear=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nBecause Phobos' orbit is below synchronous altitude, the tidal forces are lowering its orbit. It will either crash into Mars' surface or break up into a ring in about 50 million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nineplanets.org/phobos.html|title=Phobos|work=nineplanets|accesdate=July 30|accessyear=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Orbital characteristics===\nMars has an [[eccentricity (orbit)|eccentricity]] higher than most of the other planets in the solar system, and has an average distance from the Sun of roughly 230 million [[kilometers|km]] (1.5 [[Astronomical Unit|AU]]). Its [[orbital period]] is 687 (Earth) [[day]]s, but the [[sol|solar day]] (or ''sol'') on Mars is only slightly more than an Earth day: 24 hours, 39 minutes, and 35.244 seconds. See [[Timekeeping on Mars]].\n\nApproximately every 780 days [[opposition (astronomy)|opposition]] occurs, which is when Mars is nearest to Earth. This minimum distance varies between about 55 and 100 million km due to the planets' [[ellipse|elliptical]] orbits. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spds.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/marsfact.html|title=Mars Fact Sheet|work=NASA planetary factsheets|accesdate=June 13|accessyear=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The next Mars opposition will occur on [[December 24]], 2007.\n\nOn [[August 27]], [[2003]], at 9:51:13 UT, Mars made its closest approach to Earth in nearly 60,000 years: 55,758,006 km (approximately 35 million miles) without [[Light-time correction]]. This occurred when Mars was one day from [[Astronomical opposition|opposition]] and about three days from its [[perihelion]], making Mars particularly easy to see from Earth.  The last time it came so close is estimated to have been on [[September 12]], [[Middle Paleolithic|57,617 BC]]. Detailed analysis of the solar system's gravitational landscape forecasts an even closer approach in 2287. However, this record approach was only very slightly closer than other recent close approaches.  For instance, the minimum distance on [[August 22]] [[1924]] was 0.37284 [[astronomical unit|AU]], compared to 0.37271 AU on [[August 27]] [[2003]], and the minimum distance on [[August 24]] [[2208]] will be 0.37278 AU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/spacewatch/mars_10_closest_030822.html|title=NightSky Friday - Mars and Earth: The Top 10 Close Passes Since 3000 B.C.|work=Space.com|accesdate=June 13|accessyear=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n=== Life ===\n{{main|Life on Mars}}\nSome evidence suggests that the planet was once significantly more habitable than it is today, but whether living [[organism]]s ever actually existed there is still an open question.\nThe [[Viking program|Viking probes]] of the mid-1970s carried  experiments designed to detect microorganisms in Martian soil at their respective landing sites, and had some positive results, later disputed by many scientists, resulting in a continuing fight. But in America,Houston, in the Johnson space center lab, asteroid ALH84001, found in the rock from Mars organic compounds they said were deposited by primitive life forms before the meteorite was blasted into space and sent on a 15 million-year voyage to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;\n{{cite journal | author= Vladimir A.

Roughly two-thirds of all spacecraft destined for Mars have failed in one manner or another before completing or even beginning their missions. Part of this high failure rate can be ascribed to technical problems, but enough have either failed or lost communications for no apparent reason that some researchers half-jokingly speak of an Earth-Mars &quot;[[Bermuda Triangle]]&quot;, or a [[Mars Curse]], or even a reference made to a &quot;Great Galactic Ghoul&quot; that feeds on Martian spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/232/1|title=Is the Great Galactic Ghoul losing his appetite?|work=The space review|accessdate=June 13|accessyear=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Past missions===\n\nThe first successful fly-by mission to Mars was NASA's [[Mariner 4]] launched in 1964.

Then came the 1975 NASA launches of the [[Viking program]], which consisted of two orbiters, each having a lander. Both landers successfully touched down in 1976 and remained operational for many years. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://burro.astr.cwru.edu/stu/20th_far_mars.html|title=Other Mars Missions|work=Journey through the galaxy|accessdate=June 13|accessyear=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Current missions===\n\nFollowing the 1992 failure of NASA's [[Mars Observer]] orbiter, they launched the [[Mars Global Surveyor]] in 1996.

Bush]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/news/bush_plan_faq_040115.html#whenmars|title=When do we get to Mars?|work=Space.com FAQ: Bush's New Space Vision |accessdate=June 13|accessyear=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe European Space Agency hopes to land the first humans on Mars between 2030 and 2035. This will be preceded by successively larger probes, starting with the launch of the [[ExoMars]] probe 2011 or more likely 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaMI/Aurora/SEM1NVZKQAD_0.html#whenmars|title=ExoMars|work=Homepage of Aurora project at ESA |accessdate=June 20|accessyear=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the 'Mars Sample Return Mission'. Likewise, astronauts will be sent to the moon between 2020 and 2025 in preparation for this mission. Initially, the ESA had planned a joint venture with the USA, but obstacles, such as American technology law ([[ITAR]]) that prohibits the sharing of classified space technology information, has led to the EU 'going it alone', in competition with the USA.{{citeneeded}}\n\n{{Mars spacecraft}}\n\n===Astronomical observations===\n[[Image:Earth and Moon from Mars PIA04531.jpg|thumb|right|Earth and Moon from Mars, imaged by [[Mars Global Surveyor]] on [[May 8]] [[2003]] 13:00 [[UTC]]. [[South America]] is visible.]]\n{{main|Astronomy on Mars}}\nIt is now possible, with the existence of various orbiters, landers, and rovers to study [[astronomy]] from the Martian skies. In particular, the Earth and the Moon would easily be visible to the [[naked eye]]. Also, one could observe the two [[Mars' natural satellites|moons of Mars]]. The moon Phobos appears about one third the [[angular diameter]] that the full Moon appears from Earth, and when it is full it is bright enough to cast shadows. On the other hand Deimos appears more or less starlike, and appears only slightly brighter than Venus does from Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetary.org/explore/topics/mars/deimos.html|title=Deimos|work=Planetary Societies's Explore the Cosmos|accessdate=June 13|accessyear=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThere are also various phenomena well-known on Earth that have now been observed on Mars, such as [[meteor]]s and [[Aurora (phenomenon)|auroras]]. The first meteor photographed on Mars was on [[March 7]] [[2004]] by the ''[[Spirit (rover)|Spirit]]'' rover. Auroras occur on Mars, but they do not occur at the poles as on Earth, because Mars has no planetwide magnetic field.  Rather, they occur near magnetic anomalies in Mars's [[crust (geology)|crust]], which are remnants from earlier days when Mars did have a magnetic field. They would probably be invisible to the naked eye, being largely [[ultraviolet]] phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v435/n7043/abs/nature03603.html|title=Discovery of an aurora on Mars|work=Nature Magazine|accessdate=June 13|accessyear=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Observations==\n{{See also|Aspects of Mars}}\nTo a naked-eye observer, Mars usually shows a distinct yellow, orange or reddish color, and varies in brightness more than any other planet as seen from Earth over the course of its orbit, due to the fact that when furthest away from the Earth it is more than seven times as far from the latter as when it is closest (and can be lost in the Sun's glare for months at a time when least favourably positioned). At its most favourable times &amp;mdash; which occur twice every 32 years, alternately at 15 and 17-year intervals, and always between late July and late September &amp;mdash; Mars shows a wealth of surface detail to a [[telescope]]. Especially noticeable, even at low magnification, are the [[polar ice cap]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shallowsky.com/mars.html|title=Mars|work=Shallow Sky|accesdate=June 15|accessyear=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[Image:MarsSunsetCut.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Photograph of a Martian sunset taken by Spirit at Gusev crater, May 19th, 2005.]]\nA [[transit of Earth from Mars|transit of the Earth as seen from Mars]] will occur on [[November 10]], [[2084]]. At that time the Sun, the Earth and Mars will be exactly in a line.  There are also [[transit of Mercury from Mars|transits of Mercury]] and [[transit of Venus from Mars|transits of Venus]], and the moon Deimos is of sufficiently small angular diameter that its partial &quot;eclipses&quot; of the Sun are best considered transits (see [[Transit of Deimos from Mars]]).\n\nThe only [[occultation]] of Mars by Venus to be observed was that of [[October 3]], [[1590]], seen by M. Möstlin at [[Heidelberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Stephen Breyer | authorlink=Steven Albers | title=Mutual Occultation of Planets  | journal=Sky and Telescope  | year=March 1979  | volume=57 #3 | pages=220 | url=http://www.skypub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Name and symbolism==\nMars is named after the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Mars (mythology)|god of war]]. In [[Babylonia|Babylonian]] astronomy, the planet was named after ''[[Nergal]]'', their [[deity]] of fire, war, and destruction, most likely due to the planet's reddish appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uapress.arizona.edu/onlinebks/mars/chap01.htm|title= Motions of Mars|work=The Planet Mars:\nA History of Observation and Discovery|accessdate=June 13|accessyear=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] equated Nergal with their god of war, Ares, they named the planet Ἄρεως ἀστἡρ (''Areos aster''), or &quot;star of Ares&quot;. Then, following the [[Interpretatio graeca|identification]] of Ares and Mars, it was translated into Latin as ''stella Martis'', or &quot;star of Mars&quot;, or simply ''Mars''. The Greeks also called the planet Πυρόεις ''Pyroeis'' meaning &quot;fiery&quot;. In [[Hindu mythology]], Mars is known as [[Mangala]] (मंगल). The planet is also called ''Angaraka'' in [[Sanskrit]]. He is the god of war and is [[celibate]]. He is the owner of the [[Aries]] and [[Scorpio]] signs, and a teacher of the occult sciences. The planet was known by the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] as &quot;''Ḥr Dšr''&quot; or &quot;[[Horus]] the Red&quot;. The [[Hebrews]] named it ''Ma'adim'' (מאדים) - &quot;the one who blushes&quot;; this is where one of the largest [[canyons]] on Mars, the [[Ma'adim Vallis]], gets its name. It is known as ''al-Mirrikh'' in both Arabic and Persian, and ''Merih'' in Turkish. The etymology of ''al-Mirrikh'' is unknown. Ancient Persians named it ''Bahram'', the Zoroastrian god of faith. Ancient Turks called it ''Sakit''. The [[China|Chinese]], [[Japan]]ese, [[Korea|Korean]] and [[Vietnam]]ese cultures refer to the planet as 火星, or ''fire star'', a naming based on the ancient Chinese mythological cycle of [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|Five Elements]].\n\n[[Image:Symbol_mars.svg|30px|left]]Its symbol, derived from the [[astrological symbol]] of Mars, a circle with a small arrow pointing out from behind it is a stylized representation of a shield and spear used by the Roman God Mars. Mars in Roman mythology was the God of War and patron of warriors. This symbol is also used in biology to describe the male sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/multimedia/display.cfm?IM_ID=167|title= Planet Symbols|work=NASA solar system exploration|accessdate=June 13|accessyear=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n== Fictional Works ==\n{{main|Mars in fiction}}\n&lt;!---This is a SUMMARY. Add new information to the main article, Mars in fiction, not here.---&gt;\nThe depiction of Mars in fiction has been stimulated by its dramatic red color and by early scientific speculations that its surface conditions might be capable of supporting life.\n\nUntil the arrival of planetary probes, the traditional view of Mars derived from the astronomers [[Percival Lowell]] and [[Giovanni Schiaparelli]], whose observation of supposedly linear features on the planet created the myth of canals on Mars. For many years, the standard notion of the planet was a drying, cooling, dying world with ancient civilizations constructing irrigation works. Thus originated a large number of science fiction scenarios, the best known of which is [[H. G. Wells]]' ''[[The War of the Worlds (novel)|The War of the Worlds]]'', in which Martians seek to escape their dying planet by invading Earth.\n\nOf considerable note is the release of a radio broadcast of [[The War of the Worlds (radio)|War of the Worlds]] on [[October 30]], [[1938]]. It was released in the form of a news release, and many people mistook it for the truth. \n\nThe first Space Trilogy book [[Out of the Silent Planet]] created by C.S. Lewis also told the story of a man who gets sent to Malacandra which is C.S. Lewis' scientific term meaning Mars.\n\nAfter the [[Mariner program|Mariner]] and [[Viking program|Viking]] spacecraft had returned pictures of Mars as it really is, an apparently lifeless and canal-less world, these ideas about Mars had to be abandoned and a vogue for accurate, realist depictions of human colonies on Mars developed, the best known of which may be [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s [[Mars trilogy|''Mars'' trilogy]]. However, pseudo-scientific speculations about the [[Face on Mars]] and other enigmatic landmarks spotted by space probes have meant that ancient civilizations continue to be a popular theme in science fiction, especially in film.\n\nAnother popular theme, particularly among American writers, is the Martian colony that fights for independence from Earth. This is a major plot element in the novels of [[Greg Bear]] and [[Kim Stanley Robinson]], as well as the movie ''[[Total Recall (film)|Total Recall]]'' (based on a short story by [[Philip K. Dick]]) and the television series ''[[Babylon 5]]''. Many video games also use this element, such as ''[[Red Faction]]''. Mars (and its moons) were also the setting for the popular [[Doom]] video game franchise and the later [[Martian Gothic: Unification|Martian Gothic ]].\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Areography]]\n*[[Astrobiology]]\n*[[Astronomy on Mars]]\n*[[Colonization of Mars]]\n*[[Darian calendar]]\n*[[Face on Mars|Face on Mars photo article]]\n*[[Planet Mars Flag|Flag of Mars]]\n*[[Timekeeping on Mars]]\n*[[Exploration of Mars]]\n*[[List of artificial objects on Mars]]\n*[[List of craters on Mars]]\n*[[List of mountains on Mars]]\n*[[Extraterrestrial life]]\n*[[Terraforming]]\n*[[Mars Direct]]\n*[[Planets in astrology#Mars|Mars in astrology]]\n\n==References==\n&lt;div class=&quot;references-small&quot;&gt;\n&lt;references /&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n==External links==\n{{sisterlinks|Mars}}\n{{portal}}\n* [http://www.uapress.arizona.edu/onlinebks/mars/contents.htm ''The Planet Mars: A History of Observation and Discovery''],William Sheehan, The University of Arizona Press, Tucson, 1996\n* ''[http://www.cosis.net/abstracts/EGU04/06169/EGU04-A-06169.pdf Detection of methane in the Martian atmosphere: evidence for life?]'',Vladimir A.

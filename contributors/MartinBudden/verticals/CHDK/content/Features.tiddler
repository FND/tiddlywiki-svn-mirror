*'''RAW''' - CHDK can record raw files, giving you access to every bit of data the sensor saw, without compression or processing. Raw files can be manipulated on the camera, or processed on your PC. CHDK also has experimental support for the open DNG raw standard.
*'''Override Camera parameters''' - Exposures from 64s to 1/60.000s with flash sync. Full manual or priority control over exposure, aperture, ISO and focus. 
*'''Bracketing''' - Bracketing is supported for exposure, aperture, ISO, and even focus.
*'''Video Overrides''' - Control the quality or bitrate of video, or change it on the fly.
*'''Scripting''' - Control CHDK and camera features using ubasic and LUA scripts. Enables time lapse, motion detection, advanced bracketing, and much more. Many user-written scripts are available on the forum and wiki.

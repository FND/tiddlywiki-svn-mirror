*'''RAW''' - with CHDK you can create RAW files (and very soon DNG files that can be read by all gfx applications...)
*'''RAW operations''' - develop raws in-camera using different settings! merge/subtract/sum RAW files!
*'''Darkframes''' - enable or disable the taking of darkframes
*'''Override Shutter Speeds''' - go as fast as 1/60.000s or as slow as 64s - you can even sync the flash at these high speeds!
*'''Override Aperture and Iso''' - on some cameras you can push the limits a lot
*'''Add M,Tv & Av modes''' to cameras that normally don't have it - lot's of small Ixuses don't have these modes, but with CHDK they do!
*'''Custom Auto-ISO''' - that's not so common among compact cameras...
*'''Override Focus''' - you can set focus in millimeters, even when your camera normally has no MF!
*'''Bracketing''' - you can use all the aforementioned overrides in bracketing! yes, you read right, you can do bracketing now, focus bracketing, ev bracketing, etc, fully customizable!
*'''Video Overrides''' - overcome the 1GB or 1hour limit - set custom quality or bitrates (even on the fly DURING recording) - soon you can also set framerate
*'''Scripting''' - you can write ubasic or LUA scripts and run them on your camera to add even more functionality (this deserves an own wiki alone, it's so powerful!)
*'''Time Shifting''' - CHDK allows to zoom during the exposure (normally this works on DSLRS with manual lenses only!) and maybe even focus shifting!
*'''Motion detection''' - Yes, high speed motion detection ! ...can be used for a variety of things, e.g. catching lightning or water drops

*'''Override canon's powersaving''' - with CHDK the cam won't fall asleep anymore - if you enable that option
*'''Edge overlay''' - ideal for timelapses, stop-motion, stereography and many more occasions - you have to see this in order to understand it's significance
*'''Custom Curves''' - apply custom curves to your pictures - in camera!
*'''Live Histogram''' - you know this from DSLRs, now you got it in your cheap P&S - fully customizable histograms!
*'''Zebra-Mode''' - see under- and overexposure areas LIVE in the liveview - never shoot blown out pictures again!
*'''GRIDS''' - you can create and use your own grids now, depending on what you are shooting!
*'''Temperature''' - yes, CHDK reads out the temperature sensors in your camera, and it is pretty accurate (at least on camera startup)
*'''All CHDK settings''' are saved permanently in a file on your SD card'''
*'''Multi-Language Interface''' - CHDK now supports about 13 languages, and adding more languages is very easy!
*'''DOF Calculator''' - fully customizable DOF Calculator, always telling you DOF related stuff - not many DSLRs have this (if at all)
*'''Battery Icon''' - now you can see live the state of the battery (not like canon only telling you minutes before it shuts off), you can even see the actual voltage!

*'''Space Icons''' - fully customizable OSD items telling you exactly how much space you have left
*'''A clock''' - not a big feature, but many people would miss it very much without CHDK - being able to know the time without having to enter a menu is priceless...
*'''remaining video time''' - no camera has it, chdk adds it: see the remaining time of your ongoing recording - change bitrate/quality on the fly and see how this influences remaining time
*'''New OSD items''' - CHDK can show you a lot of your camera's inner settings, such as the zoom, luminance (who needs a spyder?) and so on
*'''fully customizable OSD layout''' - configure it to your liking
*'''Fonts & Colors galore''' - choose from a variety of fonts, symbols and colors for all items and the menu
*'''Filebrowser''' - move, delete and edit things on the road
*'''Textreader''' - read texts, manuals, newspaper etc on the road
*'''Calendar''' - rudimentary calendar, for those who don't know the month they are in ;)
*'''Games''' - of course what would an OpenSource Project be without Games - Play Reversi or Sokoban on your camera!
*'''REMOTE''' - you can control all these cheap cameras with a cheap DIY remote now! it's THAT easy!
*'''Benchmark''' - benchmark your sdcards in-camera and compare them to each other...
*'''there is even more â†’''' read the manual & explore this wikia...

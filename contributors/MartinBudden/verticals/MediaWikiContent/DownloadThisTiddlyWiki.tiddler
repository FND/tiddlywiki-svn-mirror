You can save this TiddlyWiki to your local drive by right clicking on [[this link|mediawikicontent.html]] and selecting 'Save link as...' or 'Save target as...'. You can choose where to save the file, and what to call it (but make sure that it's saved in HTML format and with an HTML extension).

@@There can be confusing and subtle differences between different browsers. Some points to watch:@@
* If you're using Windows XP Service Pack 2 or Windows Vista, check for known [[ServicePack2Problems|http://www.tiddlywiki.com/#ServicePack2Problems]] and [[VistaIssues|http://www.tiddlywiki.com/#VistaIssues]]
* Do ''not'' use the File/Save command in your browser to save TiddlyWiki, because of [[SaveUnpredictabilities|http://www.tiddlywiki.com/#SaveUnpredictabilities]].
* Make sure that you're saving in HTML (or "page source" format), not one of the new-fangled archive formats

<pre>==About the Disabled Village Children wiki== 
This document is based on the original Disabled Village Children book published by [[http://www.hesperian.org/|Hesperion]]. The first conversion to HTML was done by a group in Japan with help from around the world. That html version can be found [[http://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe002/dwe00201.htm|here]]. The conversion to this wiki format was done by the [[http://www.unamesa.org/|UnaMesa Association]] in early 2008.

This document is primarily a prototype to solicit feedback from Hesperion, their authors, and their audience regarding whether and how we might support the ongoing development, distribution, and collaboration to support Hesperion publications that serve global needs for healthcare and education.

Please use the discussion tabs to add your comments and feedback. Once you join this space and login, you can also directly edit any of the pages in the wiki.</pre>

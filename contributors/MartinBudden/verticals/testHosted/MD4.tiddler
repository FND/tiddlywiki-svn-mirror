'''MD4''' is a message digest [[algorithm]] (the fourth in a series) designed by Professor [[Ronald Rivest]] of [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in 1990. It implements a [[cryptographic hash function]] for use in message integrity checks. The digest length is 128 bits. The algorithm has influenced later designs, such as the [[MD5]], [[SHA]] and [[RIPEMD]] algorithms.

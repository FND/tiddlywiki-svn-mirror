description:Claude Monet made several trips to the Mediterranean between 1883 and 1908. During these visits he painted many landscapes and seascapes such as Bordighera. Famous landmarks were also a favorite subject for Monet in the Mediterranean. His paintings in Venice included the Grand Canal, Doges' Palace, and San Giorgio Maggiore. The Monet painting that was stolen in the movie The Thomas Crown Affair was San Giorgio Maggiore at Dusk.

description:Upon returning to France, in 1872 (or 1873) he painted Impression, Sunrise (Impression, soleil levant) depicting a Le Havre landscape. It hung in the first impressionist exhibition in 1874 and is now displayed in the Mus√©e Marmottan-Monet, Paris. From the painting's title, art critic Louis Leroy coined the term "impressionism", which he intended to be derogatory.

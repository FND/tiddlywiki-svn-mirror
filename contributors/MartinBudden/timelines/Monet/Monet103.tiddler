title:Entered Le Havre secondary school
description:On the first of April 1851 Monet entered the Le Havre secondary school. He first became known locally for his charcoal caricatures, which he would sell for ten to twenty francs. Monet also undertook his first drawing lessons from Jean-Francois Ochard, a former student of Jacques-Louis David (1748 - 1825). On the beaches of Normandy, he met fellow artist Eug√®ne Boudin, who became his mentor and taught him to use oil paints. Boudin taught Monet en plein air (outdoor) techniques for painting.

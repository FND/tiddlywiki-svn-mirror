<html><p>The Internet has been a major source of leisure since before the World Wide Web, with entertaining social experiments such as <a title="MUD" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD">MUDs</a> and <a title="MOO" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOO">MOOs</a> being conducted on university servers, and humor-related <a title="Usenet" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet">Usenet</a> groups receiving much of the main traffic. Today, many <a title="Internet forum" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum">Internet forums</a> have sections devoted to games and funny videos; short cartoons in the form of <a title="Flash animation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_animation">Flash movies</a> are also popular. Over 6 million people use blogs or message boards as a means of communication and for the sharing of ideas.</p> <p>The <a title="Pornography" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography">pornography</a> and <a title="Gambling" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling">gambling</a> industries have both taken full advantage of the World Wide Web, and often provide a significant source of advertising revenue for other websites. Although many governments have attempted to put restrictions on both industries' use of the Internet, this has generally failed to stop their widespread popularity.</p> <p>One main area of leisure on the Internet is <a class="mw-redirect" title="Multiplayer gaming" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplayer_gaming">multiplayer gaming</a>. This form of leisure creates communities, bringing people of all ages and origins to enjoy the fast-paced world of multiplayer games. These range from <a class="mw-redirect" title="MMORPG" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMORPG">MMORPG</a> to <a title="First-person shooter" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter">first-person shooters</a>, from <a title="Computer role-playing game" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_role-playing_game">role-playing games</a> to <a title="Online gambling" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_gambling">online gambling</a>. This has revolutionized the way many people interact and spend their free time on the Internet.</p> <p>While online gaming has been around since the 1970s, modern modes of online gaming began with services such as <a title="GameSpy Arcade" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameSpy_Arcade">GameSpy</a> and <a title="MPlayer.com" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPlayer.com">MPlayer</a>, to which players of games would typically subscribe. Non-subscribers were limited to certain types of gameplay or certain games.</p> <p>Many use the Internet to access and download music, movies and other works for their enjoyment and relaxation. As discussed above, there are paid and unpaid sources for all of these, using centralized servers and distributed peer-to-peer technologies. Some of these sources take more care over the original artists' rights and over copyright laws than others.</p> <p>Many use the World Wide Web to access news, weather and sports reports, to plan and book holidays and to find out more about their random ideas and casual interests.</p> <p>People use <a title="Online chat" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_chat">chat</a>, <a title="Instant messaging" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_messaging">messaging</a> and e-mail to make and stay in touch with friends worldwide, sometimes in the same way as some previously had <a title="Pen pal" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pen_pal">pen pals</a>. <a class="mw-redirect" title="Social networking" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_networking">Social networking</a> websites like <a title="MySpace" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySpace">MySpace</a>, <a title="Facebook" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook">Facebook</a> and many others like them also put and keep people in contact for their enjoyment.</p> <p>The Internet has seen a growing number of <a title="Web desktop" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_desktop">Web desktops</a>, where users can access their files, folders, and settings via the Internet.</p> <p><a class="mw-redirect" title="Cyberslacking" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberslacking">Cyberslacking</a> has become a serious drain on corporate resources; the average UK employee spends 57 minutes a day surfing the Web at work, according to a study by Peninsula Business Services.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-15"><a title="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet#cite_note-15"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup></p></html>

<html><p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">USSR</a>'s launch of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik" title="Sputnik" class="mw-redirect">Sputnik</a> spurred the United States to create the Advanced Research Projects Agency, known as ARPA, in February <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1958_in_science" title="1958 in science">1958</a> to regain a technological lead.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet#cite_note-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet#cite_note-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> ARPA created the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Processing_Technology_Office" title="Information Processing Technology Office" class="mw-redirect">Information Processing Technology Office</a> (IPTO) to further the research of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi_Automatic_Ground_Environment" title="Semi Automatic Ground Environment">Semi Automatic Ground Environment</a> (SAGE) program, which had networked country-wide <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar" title="Radar">radar</a> systems together for the first time. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._C._R._Licklider" title="J. C. R. Licklider">J. C. R. Licklider</a> was selected to head the IPTO, and networking as a potential unifying human revolution.</p> <p>Licklider moved from the Psycho-Acoustic Laboratory at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University" title="Harvard University">Harvard University</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology" title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">MIT</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1950_in_science" title="1950 in science">1950</a>, after becoming interested in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology" title="Information technology">information technology</a>. At MIT, he served on a committee that established <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Laboratory" title="Lincoln Laboratory">Lincoln Laboratory</a> and worked on the SAGE project. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1957_in_science" title="1957 in science">1957</a> he became a Vice President at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBN_Technologies" title="BBN Technologies">BBN</a>, where he bought the first production <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-1" title="PDP-1">PDP-1</a> computer and conducted the first public demonstration of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-sharing" title="Time-sharing">time-sharing</a>.</p> <p>At the IPTO, Licklider got <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Roberts_%28scientist%29" title="Lawrence Roberts (scientist)">Lawrence Roberts</a> to start a project to make a network, and Roberts based the technology on the work of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Baran" title="Paul Baran">Paul Baran</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet#cite_note-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> who had written an exhaustive study for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force" title="United States Air Force">U.S. Air Force</a> that recommended <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_switching" title="Packet switching">packet switching</a> (as opposed to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_switching" title="Circuit switching">circuit switching</a>) to make a network highly robust and survivable. After much work, the first two nodes of what would become the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET" title="ARPANET">ARPANET</a> were interconnected between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles" title="University of California, Los Angeles">UCLA</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRI_International" title="SRI International">SRI</a> (later SRI International) in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menlo_Park" title="Menlo Park">Menlo Park</a>, California, on October 29, 1969. The ARPANET was one of the &quot;eve&quot; networks of today's Internet.</p> <p>Following on from the demonstration that packet switching worked on the ARPANET, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Post_Office_%28United_Kingdom%29" title="General Post Office (United Kingdom)" class="mw-redirect">British Post Office</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telenet" title="Telenet">Telenet</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DATAPAC" title="DATAPAC">DATAPAC</a> and TRANSPAC collaborated to create the first international packet-switched network service. In the UK, this was referred to as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Packet_Switched_Service" title="International Packet Switched Service">International Packet Switched Service</a> (IPSS), in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1978_in_science" title="1978 in science">1978</a>. The collection of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25" title="X.25">X.25</a>-based networks grew from Europe and the US to cover Canada, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a> and Australia by 1981. The X.25 packet switching standard was developed in the CCITT (now called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITU-T" title="ITU-T">ITU-T</a>) around 1976.</p> <p>X.25 was independent of the TCP/IP protocols that arose from the experimental work of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA" title="DARPA">DARPA</a> on the ARPANET, Packet Radio Net and Packet Satellite Net during the same time period. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinton_Cerf" title="Vinton Cerf" class="mw-redirect">Vinton Cerf</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kahn" title="Robert Kahn">Robert Kahn</a> developed the first description of the TCP protocols during 1973 and published a paper on the subject in May 1974. Use of the term &quot;Internet&quot; to describe a single global TCP/IP network originated in December 1974 with the publication of <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc675" class="external" title="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc675">RFC 675</a>, the first full specification of TCP that was written by Vinton Cerf, Yogen Dalal and Carl Sunshine, then at Stanford University. During the next nine years, work proceeded to refine the protocols and to implement them on a wide range of operating systems.</p> <p>The first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol_Suite" title="Internet Protocol Suite">TCP/IP</a>-based wide-area network was operational by January 1, 1983 when all hosts on the ARPANET were switched over from the older NCP protocols. In 1985, the United States' <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Science_Foundation" title="National Science Foundation">National Science Foundation</a> (NSF) commissioned the construction of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSFNET" title="NSFNET" class="mw-redirect">NSFNET</a>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University" title="University">university</a> 56 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilobit" title="Kilobit">kilobit</a>/second network backbone using computers called &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzball_router" title="Fuzzball router">fuzzballs</a>&quot; by their inventor, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_L._Mills" title="David L. Mills">David L. Mills</a>. The following year, NSF sponsored the conversion to a higher-speed 1.5&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbps" title="Mbps" class="mw-redirect">megabit/second</a> network. A key decision to use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA" title="DARPA">DARPA</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP/IP" title="TCP/IP" class="mw-redirect">TCP/IP</a> protocols was made by Dennis Jennings, then in charge of the Supercomputer program at NSF.</p> <p>The opening of the network to commercial interests began in 1988. The US Federal Networking Council approved the interconnection of the NSFNET to the commercial <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCI_Mail" title="MCI Mail">MCI Mail</a> system in that year and the link was made in the summer of 1989. Other commercial electronic e-mail services were soon connected, including OnTyme, Telemail and Compuserve. In that same year, three commercial Internet service providers (ISP) were created: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UUNET" title="UUNET">UUNET</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSINet" title="PSINet">PSINet</a> and CERFNET. Important, separate networks that offered gateways into, then later merged with, the Internet include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet" title="Usenet">Usenet</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BITNET" title="BITNET">BITNET</a>. Various other commercial and educational networks, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telenet" title="Telenet">Telenet</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tymnet" title="Tymnet">Tymnet</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compuserve" title="Compuserve" class="mw-redirect">Compuserve</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JANET" title="JANET">JANET</a> were interconnected with the growing Internet. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telenet" title="Telenet">Telenet</a> (later called Sprintnet) was a large privately funded national computer network with free <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dial-up_access" title="Dial-up access" class="mw-redirect">dial-up access</a> in cities throughout the U.S. that had been in operation since the 1970s. This network was eventually interconnected with the others in the 1980s as the TCP/IP protocol became increasingly popular. The ability of TCP/IP to work over virtually any pre-existing communication networks allowed for a great ease of growth, although the rapid growth of the Internet was due primarily to the availability of commercial routers from companies such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Systems" title="Cisco Systems">Cisco Systems</a>, Proteon and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juniper_Networks" title="Juniper Networks">Juniper</a>, the availability of commercial <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet" title="Ethernet">Ethernet</a> equipment for local-area networking, and the widespread implementation of TCP/IP on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIX" title="UNIX" class="mw-redirect">UNIX</a> operating system.</p></html>

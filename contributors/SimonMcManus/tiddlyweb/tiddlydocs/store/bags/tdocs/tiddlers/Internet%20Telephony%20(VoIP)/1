<html><p>VoIP stands for Voice-over-<a title="Internet Protocol" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol">Internet Protocol</a>, referring to the protocol that underlies all Internet communication. The idea began in the early 1990s with <a title="Walkie-talkie" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkie-talkie">walkie-talkie</a>-like voice applications for personal computers. In recent years many VoIP systems have become as easy to use and as convenient as a normal telephone. The benefit is that, as the Internet carries the voice traffic, VoIP can be free or cost much less than a traditional telephone call, especially over long distances and especially for those with always-on Internet connections such as <a title="Cable modem" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_modem">cable</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" title="ADSL" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADSL">ADSL</a>.</p> <p>VoIP is maturing into a competitive alternative to traditional telephone service. Interoperability between different providers has improved and the ability to call or receive a call from a traditional telephone is available. Simple, inexpensive VoIP network adapters are available that eliminate the need for a personal computer.</p> <p>Voice quality can still vary from call to call but is often equal to and can even exceed that of traditional calls.</p> <p>Remaining problems for VoIP include <a title="Emergency telephone number" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_telephone_number">emergency telephone number</a> dialling and reliability. Currently, a few VoIP providers provide an emergency service, but it is not universally available. Traditional phones are line-powered and operate during a power failure; VoIP does not do so without a <a title="Uninterruptible power supply" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uninterruptible_power_supply">backup power source</a> for the phone equipment and the Internet access devices.</p> <p>VoIP has also become increasingly popular for gaming applications, as a form of communication between players. Popular VoIP clients for gaming include <a title="Ventrilo" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventrilo">Ventrilo</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" title="Teamspeak" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teamspeak">Teamspeak</a>, and others. <a title="PlayStation 3" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3">PlayStation 3</a> and <a title="Xbox 360" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360">Xbox 360</a> also offer VoIP chat features.</p></html>

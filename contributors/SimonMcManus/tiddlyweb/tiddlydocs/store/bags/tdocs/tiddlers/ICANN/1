<html><p>The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is the authority that coordinates the assignment of unique identifiers on the Internet, including <a title="Domain name" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name">domain names</a>, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, and protocol port and parameter numbers. A globally unified namespace (i.e., a system of names in which there is at most one holder for each possible name) is essential for the Internet to function. ICANN is headquartered in <a title="Marina del Rey, California" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marina_del_Rey,_California">Marina del Rey, California</a>, but is overseen by an international board of directors drawn from across the Internet technical, business, academic, and non-commercial communities. The US government continues to have the primary role in approving changes to the <a title="DNS root zone" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_root_zone">root zone</a> file that lies at the heart of the domain name system. Because the Internet is a distributed network comprising many voluntarily interconnected networks, the Internet has no governing body. ICANN's role in coordinating the assignment of unique identifiers distinguishes it as perhaps the only central coordinating body on the global Internet, but the scope of its authority extends only to the Internet's systems of domain names, <a title="IP address" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address">IP addresses</a>, protocol ports and parameter numbers.</p> <p>On November 16, 2005, the <a title="World Summit on the Information Society" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Summit_on_the_Information_Society">World Summit on the Information Society</a>, held in <a title="Tunis" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunis">Tunis</a>, established the <a title="Internet Governance Forum" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Governance_Forum">Internet Governance Forum</a> (IGF) to discuss Internet-related issues.</p></html>

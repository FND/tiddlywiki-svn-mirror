Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when she thought\nit over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have\nwondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);\nbut when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-\nPOCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to\nher feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never\nbefore seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to\ntake out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\nfield after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop\ndown a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.\n\n  In another moment down went Alice after it, never once\nconsidering how in the world she was to get out again.\n\n  The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,\nand then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a\nmoment to think about stopping herself before she found herself\nfalling down a very deep well.\n\n  Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she\nhad plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to\nwonder what was going to happen next.  First, she tried to look\ndown and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to\nsee anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and\nnoticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves;\nhere and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.  She\ntook down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was\nlabelled `ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it\nwas empty:  she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing\nsomebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she\nfell past it.\n\n  `Well!' thought Alice to herself, `after such a fall as this, I\nshall think nothing of tumbling down stairs!  How brave they'll\nall think me at home!  Why, I wouldn't say anything about it,\neven if I fell off the top of the house!' (Which was very likely\ntrue.)\n\n  Down, down, down.  Would the fall NEVER come to an end!  `I\nwonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud.\n`I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.  Let\nme see:  that would be four thousand miles down, I think--' (for,\nyou see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her\nlessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good\nopportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to\nlisten to her, still it was good practice to say it over) `--yes,\nthat's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude\nor Longitude I've got to?'  (Alice had no idea what Latitude was,\nor Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to\nsay.)\n\n  Presently she began again.  `I wonder if I shall fall right\nTHROUGH the earth!  How funny it'll seem to come out among the\npeople that walk with their heads downward!  The Antipathies, I\nthink--' (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this\ntime, as it didn't sound at all the right word) `--but I shall\nhave to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.\nPlease, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried\nto curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling\nthrough the air!  Do you think you could manage it?)  `And what\nan ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking!  No, it'll\nnever do to ask:  perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'\n\n  Down, down, down.  There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon\nbegan talking again.  `Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I\nshould think!'  (Dinah was the cat.)  `I hope they'll remember\nher saucer of milk at tea-time.  Dinah my dear!  I wish you were\ndown here with me!  There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but\nyou might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know.\nBut do cats eat bats, I wonder?'  And here Alice began to get\nrather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of\nway, `Do cats eat bats?  Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, `Do\nbats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either\nquestion, it didn't much matter which way she put it.  She felt\nthat she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she\nwas walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very\nearnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:  did you ever eat a\nbat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of\nsticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.\n\n  Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a\nmoment:  she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her\nwas another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in\nsight, hurrying down it.  There was not a moment to be lost:\naway went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it\nsay, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late\nit's getting!'  She was close behind it when she turned the\ncorner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen:  she found\nherself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps\nhanging from the roof.\n\n  There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked;\nand when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the\nother, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,\nwondering how she was ever to get out again.\n\n  Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of\nsolid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key,\nand Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the\ndoors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or\nthe key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of\nthem.  However, on the second time round, she came upon a low\ncurtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little\ndoor about fifteen inches high:  she tried the little golden key\nin the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\n\n  Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small\npassage, not much larger than a rat-hole:  she knelt down and\nlooked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.\nHow she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about\namong those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but\nshe could not even get her head though the doorway; `and even if\nmy head would go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of\nvery little use without my shoulders.  Oh, how I wish\nI could shut up like a telescope!  I think I could, if I only\nknow how to begin.'  For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things\nhad happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few\nthings indeed were really impossible.\n\n  There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she\nwent back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on\nit, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like\ntelescopes:  this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which\ncertainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck\nof the bottle was a paper label, with the words `DRINK ME'\nbeautifully printed on it in large letters.\n\n  It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little\nAlice was not going to do THAT in a hurry.  `No, I'll look\nfirst,' she said, `and see whether it's marked &quot;poison&quot; or not';\nfor she had read several nice little histories about children who\nhad got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant\nthings, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules\ntheir friends had taught them:  such as, that a red-hot poker\nwill burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your\nfinger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had\nnever forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked\n`poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or\nlater.\n\n  However, this bottle was NOT marked `poison,' so Alice ventured\nto taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort\nof mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast\nturkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished\nit off.\n\n     *       *       *       *       *       *       *\n\n         *       *       *       *       *       *\n\n     *       *       *       *       *       *       *\n\n  `What a curious feeling!' said Alice; `I must be shutting up\nlike a telescope.'\n\n  And so it was indeed:  she was now only ten inches high, and\nher face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right\nsize for going through the little door into that lovely garden.\nFirst, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was\ngoing to shrink any further:  she felt a little nervous about\nthis; `for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my\ngoing out altogether, like a candle.  I wonder what I should be\nlike then?'  And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is\nlike after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember\never having seen such a thing.\n\n  After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided\non going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice!\nwhen she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the\nlittle golden key, and when she went back to the table for it,\nshe found she could not possibly reach it:  she could see it\nquite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb\nup one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;\nand when she had tired herself out with trying,\nthe poor little thing sat down and cried.\n\n  `Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to\nherself, rather sharply; `I advise you to leave off this minute!'\nShe generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very\nseldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so\nseverely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered\ntrying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game\nof croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious\nchild was very fond of pretending to be two people.  `But it's no\nuse now,' thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people!  Why,\nthere's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable\nperson!'\n\n  Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under\nthe table:  she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on\nwhich the words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants.\n`Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, `and if it makes me grow larger,\nI can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep\nunder the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I\ndon't care which happens!'\n\n  She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `Which\nway?  Which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to\nfeel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to\nfind that she remained the same size:  to be sure, this generally\nhappens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the\nway of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen,\nthat it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the\ncommon way.\n\n  So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.\n\n     *       *       *       *       *       *       *\n\n         *       *       *       *       *       *\n\n     *       *       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n                           CHAPTER II\n\n                        The Pool of Tears\n\n\n  `Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much\nsurprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good\nEnglish); `now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that\never was!  Good-bye, feet!' (for when she looked down at her\nfeet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so\nfar off).  `Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on\nyour shoes and stockings for you now, dears?  I'm sure _I_ shan't\nbe able!  I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself\nabout you:  you must manage the best way you can; --but I must be\nkind to them,' thought Alice, `or perhaps they won't walk the\nway I want to go!  Let me see:  I'll give them a new pair of\nboots every Christmas.'\n\n  And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it.\n`They must go by the carrier,' she thought; `and how funny it'll\nseem, sending presents to one's own feet!  And how odd the\ndirections will look!\n\n            ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.\n                HEARTHRUG,\n                    NEAR THE FENDER,\n                        (WITH ALICE'S LOVE).\n\nOh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!'\n\n  Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall:  in\nfact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took\nup the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.\n\n  Poor Alice!  It was as much as she could do, lying down on one\nside, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get\nthrough was more hopeless than ever:  she sat down and began to\ncry again.\n\n  `You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, `a great\ngirl like you,' (she might well say this), `to go on crying in\nthis way!  Stop this moment, I tell you!'  But she went on all\nthe same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool\nall round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the\nhall.\n\n  After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the\ndistance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.\nIt was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a\npair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the\nother:  he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to\nhimself as he came, `Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won't she\nbe savage if I've kept her waiting!'  Alice felt so desperate\nthat she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit\ncame near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, `If you please,\nsir--'  The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid\ngloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard\nas he could go.\n\n  Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very\nhot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking:\n`Dear, dear!  How queer everything is to-day!  And yesterday\nthings went on just as usual.  I wonder if I've been changed in\nthe night?  Let me think:  was I the same when I got up this\nmorning?  I almost think I can remember feeling a little\ndifferent.  But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who in\nthe world am I?  Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!'  And she began\nthinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age\nas herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of\nthem.\n\n  `I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, `for her hair goes in such\nlong ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm\nsure I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she,\noh! she knows such a very little!  Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I,\nand--oh dear, how puzzling it all is!  I'll try if I know all the\nthings I used to know.  Let me see:  four times five is twelve,\nand four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is--oh dear!\nI shall never get to twenty at that rate!  However, the\nMultiplication Table doesn't signify:  let's try Geography.\nLondon is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome,\nand Rome--no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain!  I must have been\nchanged for Mabel!  I'll try and say &quot;How doth the little--&quot;'\nand she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons,\nand began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and\nstrange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:--\n\n            `How doth the little crocodile\n              Improve his shining tail,\n            And pour the waters of the Nile\n              On every golden scale!\n\n            `How cheerfully he seems to grin,\n              How neatly spread his claws,\n            And welcome little fishes in\n              With gently smiling jaws!'\n\n  `I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and\nher eyes filled with tears again as she went on, `I must be Mabel\nafter all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little\nhouse, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so\nmany lessons to learn!  No, I've made up my mind about it; if I'm\nMabel, I'll stay down here!  It'll be no use their putting their\nheads down and saying &quot;Come up again, dear!&quot;  I shall only look\nup and say &quot;Who am I then?  Tell me that first, and then, if I\nlike being that person, I'll come up:  if not, I'll stay down\nhere till I'm somebody else&quot;--but, oh dear!' cried Alice, with a\nsudden burst of tears, `I do wish they WOULD put their heads\ndown!  I am so VERY tired of being all alone here!'\n\n  As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was\nsurprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little\nwhite kid gloves while she was talking.  `How CAN I have done\nthat?' she thought.  `I must be growing small again.'  She got up\nand went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that,\nas nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high,\nand was going on shrinking rapidly:  she soon found out that the\ncause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it\nhastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.\n\n`That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened at\nthe sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in\nexistence; `and now for the garden!' and she ran with all speed\nback to the little door:  but, alas! the little door was shut\nagain, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as\nbefore, `and things are worse than ever,' thought the poor child,\n`for I never was so small as this before, never!  And I declare\nit's too bad, that it is!'\n\n  As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another\nmoment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water.  Her first\nidea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, `and in that\ncase I can go back by railway,' she said to herself.  (Alice had\nbeen to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general\nconclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find\na number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in\nthe sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and\nbehind them a railway station.)  However, she soon made out that\nshe was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine\nfeet high.\n\n  `I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about,\ntrying to find her way out.  `I shall be punished for it now, I\nsuppose, by being drowned in my own tears!  That WILL be a queer\nthing, to be sure!  However, everything is queer to-day.'\n\n  Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a\nlittle way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was:  at\nfirst she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then\nshe remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that\nit was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.\n\n  `Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, `to speak to this\nmouse?  Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should\nthink very likely it can talk:  at any rate, there's no harm in\ntrying.'  So she began:  `O Mouse, do you know the way out of\nthis pool?  I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!'\n(Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse:\nshe had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having\nseen in her brother's Latin Grammar, `A mouse--of a mouse--to a\nmouse--a mouse--O mouse!'  The Mouse looked at her rather\ninquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little\neyes, but it said nothing.\n\n  `Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; `I\ndaresay it's a French mouse, come over with William the\nConqueror.'  (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had\nno very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.)  So she\nbegan again:  `Ou est ma chatte?' which was the first sentence in\nher French lesson-book.  The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the\nwater, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.  `Oh, I beg\nyour pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the\npoor animal's feelings.  `I quite forgot you didn't like cats.'\n\n  `Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate\nvoice.  `Would YOU like cats if you were me?'\n\n  `Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a soothing tone:  `don't be\nangry about it.  And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah:\nI think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her.\nShe is such a dear quiet thing,' Alice went on, half to herself,\nas she swam lazily about in the pool, `and she sits purring so\nnicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face--and\nshe is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she's such a capital\none for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice again,\nfor this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt\ncertain it must be really offended.  `We won't talk about her any\nmore if you'd rather not.'\n\n  `We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end\nof his tail.  `As if I would talk on such a subject!  Our family\nalways HATED cats:  nasty, low, vulgar things!  Don't let me hear\nthe name again!'\n\n  `I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the\nsubject of conversation.  `Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?'\nThe Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly:  `There is\nsuch a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you!\nA little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly\nbrown hair!  And it'll fetch things when you throw them, and\nit'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things--I\ncan't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer, you\nknow, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds!\nHe says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a\nsorrowful tone, `I'm afraid I've offended it again!'  For the\nMouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and\nmaking quite a commotion in the pool as it went.\n\n  So she called softly after it, `Mouse dear!  Do come back\nagain, and we won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't\nlike them!'  When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam\nslowly back to her:  its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice\nthought), and it said in a low trembling voice, `Let us get to\nthe shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and you'll\nunderstand why it is I hate cats and dogs.'\n\n  It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded\nwith the birds and animals that had fallen into it:  there were a\nDuck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious\ncreatures.  Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the\nshore.\n\n\n\n                           CHAPTER III\n\n                  A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale\n\n\n  They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the\nbank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their\nfur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and\nuncomfortable.\n\n  The first question of course was, how to get dry again:  they\nhad a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed\nquite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with\nthem, as if she had known them all her life.  Indeed, she had\nquite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky,\nand would only say, `I am older than you, and must know better';\nand this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was,\nand, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no\nmore to be said.\n\n  At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among\nthem, called out, `Sit down, all of you, and listen to me!  I'LL\nsoon make you dry enough!'  They all sat down at once, in a large\nring, with the Mouse in the middle.  Alice kept her eyes\nanxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad\ncold if she did not get dry very soon.\n\n  `Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important air, `are you all ready?\nThis is the driest thing I know.  Silence all round, if you please!\n&quot;William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was\nsoon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been\nof late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest.  Edwin and\nMorcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria--&quot;'\n\n  `Ugh!' said the Lory, with a shiver.\n\n  `I beg your pardon!' said the Mouse, frowning, but very\npolitely:  `Did you speak?'\n\n  `Not I!' said the Lory hastily.\n\n  `I thought you did,' said the Mouse.  `--I proceed.  &quot;Edwin and\nMorcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him:\nand even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found\nit advisable--&quot;'\n\n  `Found WHAT?' said the Duck.\n\n  `Found IT,' the Mouse replied rather crossly:  `of course you\nknow what &quot;it&quot; means.'\n\n  `I know what &quot;it&quot; means well enough, when I find a thing,' said\nthe Duck:  `it's generally a frog or a worm.  The question is,\nwhat did the archbishop find?'\n\n  The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on,\n`&quot;--found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William\nand offer him the crown.  William's conduct at first was\nmoderate.  But the insolence of his Normans--&quot;  How are you\ngetting on now, my dear?' it continued, turning to Alice as it\nspoke.\n\n  `As wet as ever,' said Alice in a melancholy tone:  `it doesn't\nseem to dry me at all.'\n\n  `In that case,' said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, `I\nmove that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more\nenergetic remedies--'\n\n  `Speak English!' said the Eaglet.  `I don't know the meaning of\nhalf those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do\neither!'  And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile:\nsome of the other birds tittered audibly.\n\n  `What I was going to say,' said the Dodo in an offended tone,\n`was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.'\n\n  `What IS a Caucus-race?' said Alice; not that she wanted much\nto know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY\nought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.\n\n  `Why,' said the Dodo, `the best way to explain it is to do it.'\n(And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter\nday, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)\n\n  First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (`the\nexact shape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then all the party\nwere placed along the course, here and there.  There was no `One,\ntwo, three, and away,' but they began running when they liked,\nand left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know\nwhen the race was over.  However, when they had been running half\nan hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called\nout `The race is over!' and they all crowded round it, panting,\nand asking, `But who has won?'\n\n  This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of\nthought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon\nits forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare,\nin the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence.  At\nlast the Dodo said, `EVERYBODY has won, and all must have\nprizes.'\n\n  `But who is to give the prizes?' quite a chorus of voices\nasked.\n\n  `Why, SHE, of course,' said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with\none finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her,\ncalling out in a confused way, `Prizes! Prizes!'\n\n  Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand\nin her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt\nwater had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes.\nThere was exactly one a-piece all round.\n\n  `But she must have a prize herself, you know,' said the Mouse.\n\n  `Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely.  `What else have\nyou got in your pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice.\n\n  `Only a thimble,' said Alice sadly.\n\n  `Hand it over here,' said the Dodo.\n\n  Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo\nsolemnly presented the thimble, saying `We beg your acceptance of\nthis elegant thimble'; and, when it had finished this short\nspeech, they all cheered.\n\n  Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked\nso grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not\nthink of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble,\nlooking as solemn as she could.\n\n  The next thing was to eat the comfits:  this caused some noise\nand confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not\ntaste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on\nthe back.  However, it was over at last, and they sat down again\nin a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.\n\n  `You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice,\n`and why it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whisper, half\nafraid that it would be offended again.\n\n  `Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse, turning to\nAlice, and sighing.\n\n  `It IS a long tail, certainly,' said Alice, looking down with\nwonder at the Mouse's tail; `but why do you call it sad?'  And\nshe kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so\nthat her idea of the tale was something like this:--\n\n                    `Fury said to a\n                   mouse, That he\n                 met in the\n               house,\n            &quot;Let us\n              both go to\n                law:  I will\n                  prosecute\n                    YOU.  --Come,\n                       I'll take no\n                        denial; We\n                     must have a\n                 trial:  For\n              really this\n           morning I've\n          nothing\n         to do.&quot;\n           Said the\n             mouse to the\n               cur, &quot;Such\n                 a trial,\n                   dear Sir,\n                         With\n                     no jury\n                  or judge,\n                would be\n              wasting\n             our\n              breath.&quot;\n               &quot;I'll be\n                 judge, I'll\n                   be jury,&quot;\n                         Said\n                    cunning\n                      old Fury:\n                     &quot;I'll\n                      try the\n                         whole\n                          cause,\n                             and\n                        condemn\n                       you\n                      to\n                       death.&quot;'\n\n\n  `You are not attending!' said the Mouse to Alice severely.\n`What are you thinking of?'\n\n  `I beg your pardon,' said Alice very humbly:  `you had got to\nthe fifth bend, I think?'\n\n  `I had NOT!' cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.\n\n  `A knot!' said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and\nlooking anxiously about her.  `Oh, do let me help to undo it!'\n\n  `I shall do nothing of the sort,' said the Mouse, getting up\nand walking away.  `You insult me by talking such nonsense!'\n\n  `I didn't mean it!' pleaded poor Alice.  `But you're so easily\noffended, you know!'\n\n  The Mouse only growled in reply.\n\n  `Please come back and finish your story!' Alice called after\nit; and the others all joined in chorus, `Yes, please do!' but\nthe Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little\nquicker.\n\n  `What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Lory, as soon as it\nwas quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of\nsaying to her daughter `Ah, my dear!  Let this be a lesson to you\nnever to lose YOUR temper!'  `Hold your tongue, Ma!' said the\nyoung Crab, a little snappishly.  `You're enough to try the\npatience of an oyster!'\n\n  `I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!' said Alice aloud,\naddressing nobody in particular.  `She'd soon fetch it back!'\n\n  `And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?'\nsaid the Lory.\n\n  Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about\nher pet:  `Dinah's our cat.  And she's such a capital one for\ncatching mice you can't think!  And oh, I wish you could see her\nafter the birds!  Why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look\nat it!'\n\n  This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party.\nSome of the birds hurried off at once:  one old Magpie began\nwrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, `I really must be\ngetting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!' and a Canary\ncalled out in a trembling voice to its children, `Come away, my\ndears!  It's high time you were all in bed!'  On various pretexts\nthey all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.\n\n  `I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!' she said to herself in a\nmelancholy tone.  `Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm\nsure she's the best cat in the world!  Oh, my dear Dinah!  I\nwonder if I shall ever see you any more!'  And here poor Alice\nbegan to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited.\nIn a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of\nfootsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping\nthat the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to\nfinish his story.\n</div>

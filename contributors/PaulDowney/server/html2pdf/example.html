The church of St. Caimín dates to the early 13th century but is built on the site of Saint Caimín's original early medieval church. It belongs to the style of architecture known as the School of the West which was a style of building in use in Connacht before the English invasion of the kingdom in the early 1200s. </span><span xml:lang="ga" lang="ga"><span>Dún&nbsp;Guaire</span></span><span>, one of the principal towerhouse of the </span><span xml:lang="ga" lang="ga"><span>Ó&nbsp;hEidhin</span></span><span> clan, is located to the east of the village.

In 1831, a large force of Terry Alts gathered on the border between Kinvara parish and Oughtmama parish, Burren, County Clare and challenged the English Crown forces to battle. They, however, dispersed before the arrival of the English forces. They also unsuccessfully attempted to ambush a body of English infantry at Corranroe in the west of the parish, which led to the death of one of their members.</span></p><span> </span><p><span>Kinvara's population according to the </span><a title="Central Statistics Office (Ireland)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Statistics_Office_%28Ireland%29"><span>2002 Census</span></a><span> was 945.

From around the 1980s the population of the parish of Kinvara started to increase while the village started to grow in size.</span></p><span> </span><p><span>The first shots of the 1916 </span><a title="Easter Rising" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Rising"><span>Easter Rising</span></a><span> in County Galway were fired in Kinvara.

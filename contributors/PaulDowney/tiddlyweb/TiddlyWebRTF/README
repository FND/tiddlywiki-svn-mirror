A TiddlyWeb plugin to serialize bags, recipes and tiddlers as Rich Text Format (RTF) documents.

Issues:
    - needs to understand TiddlyDocs 'document' tiddler, containing document order. 
    - TiddlyDocs 'document' tiddler to be standardized across trails, s5 etc plugins
    - table of contents (possibly by including the 'document' tiddler)
    - document style parameters such as fonts and sizes to be take from config/tiddler
    - document header, footer to come from tiddlers
    - RTF meta-data section such as author, date published, copyright etc to come from config/tiddler

A TiddlyWeb plugin to serialize bags, recipes and tiddlers as Rich Text Format (RTF) documents.

Depends on html5lib for parsing HTML output by the TiddlyWeb renderer
Also depends on with Safe=False

Task list:
    - HTML tag support is currently very limited (actually none!), need to support tables, images, etc
    - Unicode tests and mapping
    - needs to understand TiddlyDocs 'document' tiddler, containing document order. 
    - TiddlyDocs 'document' tiddler to be standardized across trails, s5 etc plugins
    - table of contents (possibly by including the 'document' tiddler)
    - document style parameters such as fonts and sizes to be take from config/tiddler
    - document header, footer to come from tiddlers
    - RTF meta-data section such as author, date published, copyright etc to come from config/tiddler 
    - move RTF into separate library

RTF info:

    Python libraries
    http://pyrtf.sourceforge.net/
    http://code.google.com/p/pyrtf-ng/ 

    Good book:

    Cutting and pasting HTML into Mac TextEdit and saving as RTF is very instructional.

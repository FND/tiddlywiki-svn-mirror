<pre>Building on the examples presented in the [[Workshop call for participation|Workshop on Security for Access to Device APIs from the Web]], examples of features which are of interest to a TiddlyWiki developer could include:
* location data from GPS and other sources
* network connectivity, bandwidth available and usage
* battery levels and power consumption
* access to personal data held in calendars and address books
* access to metadata and content held in music libraries
* access to metadata and images held in photo albums
* photographs and data held on cameras
* the ability to launch external applications
Ideally, these should be made available to TiddlyWiki as JavaScript functions, and in a browser independent way. To that end, we support the efforts of to standardise common practice in the [[Web Applications|http://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/]], [[Geolocation|http://www.w3.org/2008/geolocation/]], [[Ubiquitous Web Applications|http://www.w3.org/2007/uwa/]] and [[HTML|http://www.w3.org/html/wg/]] Working Groups.</pre>

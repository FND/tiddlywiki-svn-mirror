<pre>The [[Workshop call for participation|Workshop on Security for Access to Device APIs from the Web]] describes the Web as becoming a "ubiquitous development platform" where "application developers have a need to access [[features|Device APIs]] available on the computers or devices on which their Web application (through a browser or through a widget) is running".  This statement, along with the assertion "The Web is becoming a compelling alternative to locally installed applications", matches our experience, however we would like to draw the Workshop's attention to a class of application which falls somewhere between these two extremes, that of [[HTML Applications]].</pre>

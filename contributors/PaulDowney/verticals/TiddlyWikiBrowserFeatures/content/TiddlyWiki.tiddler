<pre>TiddlyWiki is an [[Open Source]] [[wiki|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki]] implemented in a single HTML file containing CSS, JavaScript and the content stored in a series of sections, or [[Tiddlers|Tiddler]]. You are encouraged to read a TiddlyWiki by following links rather than sequentially, which a number of authors have found a novel medium for writing, promoting a distinctive writing style. 

In addition to textual content, a tiddler may be a [[plugin|http://www.tiddlywiki.com/#Plugins]] containing additional JavaScript and CSS to extend TiddlyWiki and has resulted in a wide variety of adaptations and [[Use Cases]] beyond that of a personal wiki.</pre>

<pre>A [[HTML Application|HTML Applications]] opened from a file URI isn't bound by [[same origin policy|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy]] when accessing the Web from JavaScript using [[XHR|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest]]. This enables a number of interesting [[Use Cases]] normally precluded from a client side application, in particular collecting data from a wide variety of sources and mashing up public resources with private or localized data.

Browsers such as Firefox 3.0, represent cookies for an [[XHR|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest]] to another domain, enabling [[session hijacking|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_hijacking]]. This is useful for some [[Use Cases]], but does raise opportunities for a [[malicious HTML application|Security]].

For services using delegated authentication such as [[Fickr|http://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.userauth.html]] and [[OAuth|http://oauth.net/]], the inability to redirect from the Web back to a file URI means [[HTML Applications]] have to behave as an installed application. This requires a user requesting permission for TiddlyWiki to access a resource to visit a Web site in a separate window or tab, grant access and then return to the TiddlyWiki and click a button or link before authorization may complete.</pre>

<pre>Hello! This is a [[TiddlyWiki|http://tiddlywiki.com]] to create ~PocketBooks, small [[dinky booklets|http://natbat.net/2009/May/21/pocketbooks/]] which are made from a single piece of paper. 

This version has a few //issues//, notably printing only works in modern browsers which support CSS transforms, such as Safari and Firefox 3.5 beta.</pre>

<pre>It is hard to estimate the number of people using and developing with TiddlyWiki largely due to the number of private and offline [[Use Cases]]. A small indication of the vibrancy of the TiddlyWiki community may be gleamed from the [[TiddlyWiki Discussion Group|http://groups.google.com/group/TiddlyWiki]] and [[TiddlyWiki Developer Group|http://groups.google.com/group/TiddlyWikiDev]] which are consistently highly active, with more than 3,500 participants exchanging 800-1000 and 200-300 posts per month, respectively.</pre>

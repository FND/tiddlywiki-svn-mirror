<pre>Whilst we are excited by the possibilities offered by the world of [[Device APIs]], we are concerned that access should be granted in an open and consistent way, across browsers, in a way which doesn't //unpleasantly surprise// users.

A TiddlyWiki user having traversed the challenges presented by [[File Saving]],  places a great deal of trust in the authors of TiddlyWiki as well as any plugins they maybe using. Whilst [[Open Source]] and view source makes incorporating malicious software into TiddlyWiki difficult to hide, it would be helpful if the granularity of security opened up was made clearer by browsers, and is an constant way. To this end we support the efforts of the [[Web Security Context Working Group|http://www.w3.org/2006/WSC/]] working group. </pre>

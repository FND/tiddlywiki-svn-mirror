<pre>As a single HTML file, TiddlyWiki makes an ideal [[Guerilla Wiki|http://tiddlywiki.com/#GuerillaWiki]] and whilst there are many instances of TiddlyWiki on the Web, the majority of ~TiddlyWikis reside behind corporate firewalls, on personal computers and are exchanged on thumb drives and over email, in a manor similar to word processing documents and spreadsheets. 

The extensible nature of TiddlyWiki combined with [[Features]] arising from being a [[HTML Application|HTML Applications]] enabled the [[Community]] to use TiddlyWiki as a JavaScript framework to build specialisations  including a wide variety of [[Server Side]] adaptations, a number of task management tools including [[TeamTasks|http://getteamtasks.com/]], a number of Web clipping tools including [[TiddlySnip|http://tiddlysnip.com/#About]], a [[Message Vault|http://www.kokogiak.com/gedankengang/2007/03/introducing-message-vault.html]], and a collaborative note taking tool [[RippleRap|http://ripplerap.com]]. There is a plethora of plugins and other examples in the expansive [[TiddlyTools|http://www.tiddlytools.com/]]. [[SocialText|http://www.socialtext.net]] uses TiddlyWiki to provide an [[unplugged|http://www.socialtext.net/open/index.cgi?socialtext_unplugged]]  experience. [[Osmosoft]] have been using TiddlyWiki to front-end enterprise systems, improving the user experience and providing offline for  [[BT]]'s HR and expenses systems. 

Experiments on the future direction of TiddlyWiki include [[Project Cecily]] and [[JigglyWiki]].

There are many further [[examples|http://tiddlywiki.com/#Examples]] of [[adaptations|http://tiddlywiki.com/#]] listed on http://tiddlywiki.com, the [[TiddlyWiki community wiki|http://tiddlywiki.org]] as well as on the [[TiddlyWiki Wikipedia page|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TiddlyWiki]] page.</pre>

<pre>Sometimes dubbed "[[Single Page Application|http://code.google.com/p/trimpath/wiki/SinglePageApplications]]" (SPA) or a "[[client-side|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client-side_scripting]] [[mashup|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(web_application_hybrid)]]", an HTML file opened from a file URI enjoys greater privileges than a server hosted [[Web application|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application]], whilst remaining compatible with a wider variety of browsers and operating environments than desktop [[widgets|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widget_engine]] which rely upon vendor specific browser extensions or locally installed applications. 

A HTML file served from a HTTP URI is constrained by the security model of the Web browser, in particular with respect to:
*reading and writing to local files and resources - [[File Saving]], [[Writing Other Files]]
*accessing [[content|Tiddler]] on remote sites - [[Server Side]], [[Synchronization]]
*reading and writing cookies - [[Synchronization]], [[File URI Cookies]]
A HTML file opened locally in a browser, from a file URI, is typically subject to fewer of these restrictions. The relaxation of these restrictions differs between browsers and operating systems and is apparently not widely understood or employed, with the notable exception of TiddlyWiki.

[[Microsoft HTA]], is a formalisation of the concept of a HTML Application, is confined to Windows systems and has a different security model to files with a .HTML extension opened inside a browser.</pre>

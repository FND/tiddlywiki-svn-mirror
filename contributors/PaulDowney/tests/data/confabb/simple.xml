    <title>Web 2.0 Conference 2006</title>
    <link>http://staging.confabb.com/conferences/16074-web-2-0-conference-2006/sessions</link>

    <!-- conference description -->
    <description>The Web 2.0 Conference focuses on emerging business and technology developments that utilize the Web as a platform and defines how the Web will drive business in the future. Now that the Web has become a robust platform with countless innovations driving its ongoing development, widespread disruptions in traditional business models are well underway. But within the chaos of disruption lies the seeds of opportunity. We'll focus on the startups and financiers tending those seeds, of course - including the second annual Launch Pad. But we'll also highlight how the incumbents are also taking advantage of disruption, or, at the very least, how they are responding to it so as to protect their market positions.</description>

      <title> The Next Internet Infrastructure</title>
      <link>http://staging.confabb.com/conferences/16074-web-2-0-conference-2006/sessions/21/details</link>

      <description>Now that social networking and video submission sites are proving to be big draws, what other 'infrastructure' will be needed to drive 'the next generation Internet?' Can we imagine a future where tags, ID systems and event databases are shared by all - and not owned by a single vendor? How 'bout pooling resources to create exciting new kinds of user interface controls or provide ubiquitous storage or grid computational power to all?</description>

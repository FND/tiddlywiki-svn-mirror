This isn't very good but it might be of some use. It's the best attempt we have at showing a list of subprojects.
<<mgtdList title:'Subprojects' startTag:Project tags:'Project && !Complete' view:Project mode:global
	where:tiddler.hasParent('Project')
	group:Project
	gView:bold
	newButtonTags:'Project Active'
	leftoverTitle:'(Projects that aren't subprojects)
	>>

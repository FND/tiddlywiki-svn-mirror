* Could replace stuff like ${title} in ViewTemplates with the name of the tiddler. It's like {{{<<view title>>}}} but happens before wikification. 
* Need a version of forEach that is:
** easier to nest
** has a writewikied action, eg instead of this:
*** {{{write '"<<asdfa"+tiddler.title+"thing:\""+context.inTiddler.title+"\"$))'}}}
** how about this:
*** {{{writewikified '<<asdfa $tiddler.title thing:$content.inTiddler.title$))'}}}
* need to make reusable components for viewtemplates. Perhaps macro wrappers to forEach.

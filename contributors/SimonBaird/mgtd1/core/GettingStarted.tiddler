Welcome to your brand new [[MonkeyPirateTiddlyWiki|http://simonbaird.com/mptw/]]. This is the standard empty [[TiddlyWiki|http://www.tiddlywiki.com/]] (version <<version>>) preconfigured with a few bits and pieces from MPTW, in particular the layout, the colours, and the popular [[TagglyTagging|http://simonbaird.com/mptw/#TagglyTagging]]. If you're new to ~TagglyTagging then try the (slightly out-of-date) [[FAQ|http://simonbaird.com/mptw1/#TagglyTaggingFAQ]] and [[Tutorial|http://simonbaird.com/mptw1/#TagglyTaggingTutorial]].

To get started with this blank TiddlyWiki, you'll need to modify the following tiddlers:
* SiteTitle & SiteSubtitle: The title and subtitle of the site, as shown above (after saving, they will also appear in the browser title bar)
* MainMenu: The menu (usually on the left)
* DefaultTiddlers: Contains the names of the tiddlers that you want to appear when the TiddlyWiki is opened
You'll also need to enter your username for signing your edits: <<option txtUserName>>

To create your own tiddlers, click 'new tiddler' in the right sidebar. To edit a tiddler click the 'edit' button in the tiddler's toolbar. To save all your tiddlers click 'save changes' in the right sidebar. If you're new to TiddlyWiki check out the formatting info [[here|http://www.tiddlywiki.com/#MainFeatures]].

Use this to import tiddlers from another TiddlyWiki. You can use a local file (click Browse...) or type the url of an online TiddlyWiki.

To change your colour scheme you can edit the styles in StyleSheet. (Refer to StyleSheetColors and StyleSheetLayout for all styles used).

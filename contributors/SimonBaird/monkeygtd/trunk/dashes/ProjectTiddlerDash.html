~MJL20070205 - Customized Project Tiddler.
This overrides the ProjectTiddlerDash shadow tiddler from MonkeyGTD 2.1 alpha r77 with a new dashboard focussing on
the GTD weekly review task.  I have added these features:

    * An ability to see Completed projects and to remove old tasks via the DeleteDoneTasks macro
    * Separate out the Someday/Maybe projects to help with assessing if any can be activated
    * GTD Weekly Review instructions
    * Inspiration for new ideas during review
    * A link to a Review How To tiddler that guides me through the GTD process

<pre>Hi!

Here's what's happening...
#You send your update to Twitter ending with 'L:location' (from your phone)
#TiddlyCity collects your update from Twitter and turns it into a tiddler
#...it uses Google local search to get an address
#Your tweets are displayed on a Yahoo! map
#A KML file is saved that you can upload for use with Google Maps and Google Earth

<<TiddlyCity>>

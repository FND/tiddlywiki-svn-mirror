<pre>Caroline: as a knowledge worker...
* I want direct access to Naomi's research so I can access it at my convenience
* I want to be able to communicate with Naomi about her research as she is writing it so she can respond to my changing needs and we can discuss areas of confusion
* I want to easily combine information from Naomi with information from others so it takes me less time to pull together a report</pre>

<pre># Don't forget to save and reload your ~TiddlyWiki after installing the package...
# You might want to put [[Welcome to TiddlyChatter]] and/or [[TiddlyChatter]] in your MainMenu or DefaultTiddlers.
# The key to ~TiddlyChatter is your subscription to someone else's &quot;~ChatterFeed&quot;. You have been set up with one subscription, called ChatterFeed, to some test content on http://tiddlychatter.tiddlyspot.com. You can manage your subscriptions from the main [[TiddlyChatter]] tiddler. Click &quot;manage&quot; and then &quot;new subscription&quot; and put in the URL of a ~TiddlyWiki which is publishing a feed.
#* Currently (as at 16/10/07), ~TiddlyChatter supports subscribing to only one person's feed - if you want to subscribe to someone other than the test content on tiddlychatter.tiddlyspot.com, change the URL field in ChatterFeed

Hitting &quot;Get&quot; downloads your updates. New content is displayed in red. When you save your ~TiddlyWiki, your own updates are published into your feed.</pre>

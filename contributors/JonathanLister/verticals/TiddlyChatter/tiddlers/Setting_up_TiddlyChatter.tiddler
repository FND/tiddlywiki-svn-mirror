<pre>The key to ~TiddlyChatter is your subscription to someone else's "~ChatterStream", which you can manage from the [[TiddlyChatter control panel|lv macro]]. Click "manage" and then "new subscription" and put in the URL of a ~TiddlyWiki which is publishing a stream. You have been set up with one subscription, called ChatterFeed, to some test content on the web.

Currently, ~TiddlyChatter supports subscribing to one person's stream.

Hitting "Get" downloads your updates. New content is displayed in red. When you save your ~TiddlyWiki, your own updates are published into your stream.

All the tiddlers necessary to run ~TiddlyChatter are tagged <<tag TiddlyChatter>> for ease of import.</pre>

<pre>The key to ~TiddlyChatter is your subscription to someone else's "~ChatterStream", which you can manage from [[TiddlyChatter control panel]]. Click "new subscription" and put in the URL of a ~TiddlyWiki which is publishing a stream. You have been set up with one subscription called ChatterFeed to some test content on the web.

''You need to make sure that the "Tag for import" field in ImportWorkspacePlugin is set to "publish", or the menu button to get your updates won't apear.'' At 09/10/07, it is still set as a cookie...

Currently, ~TiddlyChatter supports subscribing to one person's stream.

Hitting "Go chatter!" in the MainMenu gets your updates. When you save your ~TiddlyWiki, your own updates are published into your stream.</pre>

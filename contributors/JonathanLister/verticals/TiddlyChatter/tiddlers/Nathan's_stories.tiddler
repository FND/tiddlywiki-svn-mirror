<pre>Nathan: as a teacher...
* I want to see what my students are doing do I can identify opportunities to give feedback, intervene or just check progress
* I want to give feedback on my students' work so it helps them get round a problem or stops them running into one
* I want to share what I do with like-minded teachers so I can inspire them or learn from their work and feedback</pre>

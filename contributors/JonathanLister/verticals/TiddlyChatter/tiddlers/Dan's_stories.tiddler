<pre>Dan: as a boss...
* I want to spend less time answering email so I have more time to be productive (and can get rid of the Crackberry!)
* I want to keep an eye on my team's work in a less intrusive way so they can be more productive
* I want easy access to my team's work as and when I need it, so I can respond to my clients and my boss in a rapid manner</pre>

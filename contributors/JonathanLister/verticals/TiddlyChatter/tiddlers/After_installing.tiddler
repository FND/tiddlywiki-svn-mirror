<pre># Don't forget to save and reload your ~TiddlyWiki after installing the package...
# You might want to put [[Welcome to TiddlyChatter]] and/or [[TiddlyChatter]] in your MainMenu or DefaultTiddlers.
# The key to ~TiddlyChatter is your subscription to someone else's "~ChatterFeed". You have been set up with one subscription, called ChatterFeed, to some test content on http://tiddlychatter.tiddlyspot.com. You can manage your subscriptions from the main [[TiddlyChatter]] tiddler. Click "manage" and then "new subscription" and put in the URL of a ~TiddlyWiki which is publishing a feed.</pre>

<div title="BUGS" modifier="Jon Lister" created="200710051013" changecount="2">
<pre>* Lack of modifier (person) on imported content from http://jonny.jonathan.googlepages.com/tiddlychatter_test.xml - is this a problem to do with cookies or the creation of content/notes? - UPDATE: modifiers not being picked up in imported content
* sorting of incoming list not sorted (want to sort by date of latest update but only display parent content)
* refresh mechanism not implemented
* streams being published in their own streams - is this right?
* inconsistency between "stream" and "channel" references - should all be stream
* ImportWorkspacePlugin defaulting to GooglePages feed (as setup in "collab") - why? - UPDATE: doesn't work after deleting the  Google feed until you refresh the page (although this could be because it's in the MainMenu)
* Notes not getting put into the correct feed</pre>
</div>

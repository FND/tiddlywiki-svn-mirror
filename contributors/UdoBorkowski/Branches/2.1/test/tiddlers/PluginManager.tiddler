<div tiddler="PluginManager" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200607281707" created="200607281707" tags="">This {{{&lt;&lt;plugins&gt;&gt;}}} macro is intended to provide a kind of control panel for TiddlyWiki plugins. From here you can see what [[Plugins]] are loaded, examine their status and disable or force execution as required.\n\nAs part of this change, new PluginFormat has been introduced that uses TiddlerSlicing to define some standardised information to describe a plugin.\n\n&lt;&lt;plugins&gt;&gt;</div>

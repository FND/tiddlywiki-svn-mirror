<div tiddler="HelloThere" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200607301112" created="200511221854" tags="welcome">Welcome to the beta 1 release of revision 2.1 of TiddlyWiki. Feedback and discussion is welcome in the [[TiddlyWikiDev Google group|http://groups.google.com/group/TiddlyWikiDev]].\n\n@@Note - this is unstable, potentially broken ''beta'' code: it's not quite finished and it's not been tested with the various [[Plugins]] on which TiddlyWiki users rely. Don't use it for anything important unless you know what you're doing.@@\n\nThis substantial new release of TiddlyWiki adds several features:\n* A PluginManager to make it easier to use TiddlyWiki [[Plugins]]\n* New PluginFormat conventions\n* An ImportTiddlers wizard macro to easily get [[Plugins]] and other content from other TiddlyWiki files\n* A new ColorPalette that makes it easier to change the overall colour scheme of TiddlyWiki (see the AlternativeColorPalette for an example)\n* TiddlerFields for [[Plugins]] to store custom metadata attached to a tiddler\n* TiddlerSlicing for extracting chunks from a tiddler\n* The beginnings of a security infrastructure with TiddlerFingerprints\n* A new ListView gadget for displaying tabular data\n* Basic support for XMLHttpRequest operations\n* Partial compliance with XHTML (full compliance will be possible via [[Plugins]])\n* The ability to use tags to SwitchFormatters for a particular tiddler\n* Improvements to the DateFormatString, including ISO-8601 week numbers\n* The ability to use the tab key to type tab characters instead of to skip fields (see AdvancedOptions)\n* Improved performance for many common operations\n* Extensive bug fixes and refactorings\nSee the full [[release note at tiddlywiki.org|http://trac.tiddlywiki.org/tiddlywiki/wiki/ReleaseNoteTwoPointOne]]</div>

<div tiddler="SystemConfig" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200507130814" created="200507130814" tags="features">The new SystemConfig feature allows arbitrary JavaScript code to be executed at startup from any tiddler that is tagged with 'systemConfig', one of the new SpecialTags.\n\nFor example, there's an ExampleSystemConfig. If you add the appropriate tag to it, SaveChanges and reload, you'll see how user interface text and other options can be changed.\n\nThe intention is that entire [[Macros]] can be delivered as a single tiddler - I'll add more documentation on the details over the next few days.</div>

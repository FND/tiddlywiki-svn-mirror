<div tiddler="AreaBug" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200508181341" created="200508181341" tags="history">Ever since the FirstVersion, TiddlyWiki has used a simple StorageFormat based on HTML DIVs for delivering its content. It looked like this:\n\n{{{\n&lt;div id=&quot;storeArea&quot;&gt;\n &lt;div id=&quot;storeHelloThere&quot;\n                  modified=&quot;200507080016&quot;\n                modifier=&quot;JeremyRuston&quot;\n  tags=&quot;welcome about&quot;&gt;\n Welcome to TiddlyWiki\n &lt;/div&gt;\n...\n&lt;/div&gt;\n}}}\n\nIt's simple; just a bunch of DIVs that live within a container called 'storeArea'. There's a blinding problem with it, though, which I managed not to notice for far too long.\n\n//What happens if there's a tiddler called 'Area'?//\n\nAnd the ignoble answer is that TiddlyWiki blithely creates a DIV with the id 'storeArea' to save it. It works just fine until you come to reload the page; HTML throws its hands up in dismay at seeing //two// DIVs with the same ID of 'storeArea'... ''Ouch''.\n\nTo resolve this problem I've slightly adjusted the StorageFormat in this new revision; it'll still read the old format for backwards compatibility, so upgrades should work fine (but, for the first time, downgrades won't work).</div>

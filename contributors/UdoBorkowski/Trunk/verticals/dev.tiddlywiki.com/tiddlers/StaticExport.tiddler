<div tiddler="StaticExport" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200601140036" created="200601140031" tags="featureIdeas">A macro that creates a static HTML version of a TiddlyWiki that can be read on really primitive downlevel devices. It:\n* uses a different wikilink wikifier to generate HTML # links to jump between tiddlers\n** the anchors themselves will need to be set in the PageTemplate, presumably?\n** it's readonly, so there's no point in rendering links to non-existent tiddlers\n** it'll need some mechanism to enable macros like slider to stop themselves doing the wrong thing\n* wikifies all tiddlers to an offscreen buffer, it uses innerHTML to read the HTML text\n** (the ordering options might include an override of the content of the DefaultTiddlers and then the rest in alphabetical order, or alphabetical order of tags, or something)\n* puts the html into a special template stored in a tiddler of it's own\n* the template mechanism needs to cope with things like inserting the {{{&lt;title&gt;}}} element as well as the main store area</div>

<div tiddler="TiddlyWiki" modifier="JeremyRuston" modified="200509270006" created="200509270006" tags="concepts">The main TiddlyWiki site is at http://www.tiddlywiki.com/\n\nA TiddlyWiki is like a blog because it's divided up into neat little chunks, but it encourages you to read it by hyperlinking rather than sequentially: if you like, a non-linear blog analogue that binds the individual microcontent items into a cohesive whole. I think that TiddlyWiki represents a novel medium for writing, and will promote its own distinctive WritingStyle. This is the ThirdVersion of TiddlyWiki, which adds several NewFeatures. There are also several TiddlyWikiAdaptations by other developers.</div>

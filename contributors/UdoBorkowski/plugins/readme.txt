This directory contains plugins provide by abego Software (http://tiddlywiki.abego-software.de). 

This way users can cook up TiddlyWikis that use these plugins without having to manually copy them.

The directory should always contain the latest version of each plugin, but the primary publishing location for these plugins is still http://tiddlywiki.abego-software.de. So case of doubt there you will find the latest stuff.

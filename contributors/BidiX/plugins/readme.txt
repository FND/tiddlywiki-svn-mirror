This directory contains plugins provide by BidiX (http://tiddlywiki.bidix.info). 

This way users can cook up TiddlyWikis that use these plugins without having to manually copy them. Add a line like :
tiddler: ../../../contributors/BidiX/plugins/PasswordOptionPlugin.js
in the index.html.recipe file of the vertical site

This directory should always contain the latest version of each plugin, but the primary publishing location is still http://tiddlywiki.bidix.info/.
